Whats new in 0.8.6
    * added --shortlines=PERCENT option, to help with documents that don't use 
      indented paragraphs and don't have vertical spacing after paragraphs.
      The argument is a value between 1 and 100. If 0 is specified, the
      the default value is used (80%). If a paragraph has a line that is 
      less than the specified percentage of the longest line, it will be
      considered the end of a paragraph. This option is only necessary for
      poorly formatted fiction books, or perhaps for ebooks that are
      oriented for very tiny screens, that don't want to waste any vertical
      spacing or lose the space from the paragraph indent.
    * added --nonfiction option, to specify that short lines don't necessarily
      mean end of paragraph. This is non necessary for typical fiction 
      books that use either indented paragraphs or have vertical spacing after
      a paragraph. It is necessary for books that use block quoting that
      has an inset margin that is the same as the paragraph indent.
    * added --print option, to print out the contents of a single with, 
      with line numbers, to standard error. This is useful for determining
      the line number argument for the --center option
      
Whats new in 0.8.5
    * added a way to specify where the center X position to use for centered 
      paragraphs with the --center=line_spec option. See pdfreflow.html for 
      more info.
    * font sizes in HTML are now relative sizes using percentages. Its 
      possible to specify the previous behavior with absolute font sizes
      using the --absolute flag. See pdfreflow.html for more info.
    * the output HTML and imbedded CSS styles are simpler because of using
      the HTML default font

Whats new in 0.8.4
    * now building for Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy Heron and Mac OSX 10.5 Leopard (and 
      later)
    * documents using double spaced lines are supported
    * don't print all debug options in --help, but added --showdebug option 
      instead
    * documents with only large fonts would not reflow correctly
    * added --lineheight debugging option to print line height frequency
