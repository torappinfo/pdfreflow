<text top="769" left="9" width="88" height="20" font="3">Introduction</text>
<text top="801" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">AUTOBIOGRAPHIES mainly concerned with the description of outer life events are today perhaps only written by </text>
<text top="815" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">statesmen, that is in a field where the external historical conditions are more important for the reader than the man and </text>
</page>
<page number="2" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="842" width="595">
<text top="3" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">his character itself. Only since Goethe's 'Dichtung und Wahrheit' can we talk about real autobiographies, since only the </text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">author himself can report adequately, if at all, about the inner process of his maturing and about the ways of his feeling. </text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">Therefore, autobiographies have commanded the literary field in the West during the past century, when men have been </text>
<text top="45" left="9" width="546" height="13" font="5">apt and able to introvert in a systematic way and thus to explore the vast field of their inner life. Such efforts have </text>
<text top="59" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">recently found their highest pitch in the psychologist C. G. Jung's fascinating account of the ups-and-downs of his inner </text>
<text top="73" left="9" width="270" height="13" font="5">development even to the very depths of his unconscious.</text>
<text top="99" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">In India we find beginnings of such autobiographical statements as early as the Upanishads and again in our own time, </text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">partly influenced by Western trends. Autobiographies by Yogis have been extremely rare, partly because the Yogi is </text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">well aware of the importance of keeping and living with a secret and partly because he properly shares the secret only </text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">with God and not with the people in his surroundings who are less aware of the subtle workings of inner tendencies.</text>
<text top="167" left="9" width="528" height="13" font="5">Only in a few instances have great men of wisdom in India revealed themselves to us in self-descriptions, like </text>
<text top="181" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">Yogananda, Ramdas and Sivananda. In most cases it has been Westerners who, because of their search for stimulation </text>
<text top="195" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">from a foreign way of self-introspection, have discovered and published the achievements of the Indian masters of </text>
<text top="208" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">Yoga, so did Paul Brunton reveal Ramana Maharishi to the West and also to India, and so Romain Rolland became </text>
<text top="222" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">fascinated with Ramakrishna, Friedrich Heiler with Sadhu Sundar Singh, Annie Besant with Krishnamurti, Jean Herbert </text>
<text top="236" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">with Ramdas. Now James Hillman and F. J. Hopman have discovered Gopi Krishna, whose sensational autobiography </text>
<text top="250" left="9" width="295" height="13" font="5">they help to publish and to interpret in the psychological way.</text>
<text top="276" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">It remains for me, as an historian of world religions, to introduce this book by putting it into the framework of Indian </text>
<text top="290" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">religious history. For Gopi Krishna is of unusual interest, first as an example of a most thorough-going mixture of East </text>
<text top="304" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">and West, and secondly as a self-taught prophet of an original kind. Gopi Krishna's approach appears as a great surprise </text>
<text top="318" left="9" width="547" height="13" font="5">because in his book, except for the last chapter, there is no mention of spirituality, religion and metaphysics. Gopi </text>
<text top="332" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">Krishna's endeavours appear as a historical laboratory in which he, the author, develops genuinely in himself what </text>
<text top="346" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">others have developed before him. But he re-mains independent of his fore-runners, who frequently have wound up in </text>
<text top="360" left="9" width="541" height="13" font="5">sterile intellectual formulae. By contrast, this self-taught, Guru-less author remains genuine in all his discoveries.</text>
<text top="386" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">Being exposed to Gopi Krishna's experiences is like meeting a space traveller who seemingly for no purpose has landed </text>
<text top="400" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">on a strange and unknown star without the standard equipment of the professional astronaut, and who simply reports </text>
<text top="414" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">about the bewildering landscape around him, colourfully, truthfully, without really knowing exactly what he has found. </text>
<text top="428" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">We have here, in this wholly unintellectual personality, a classical example of a simple man, uneducated in Yoga, who </text>
<text top="442" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">yet through intense labour and persistent enthusiasm, succeeds in achieving, if not Samadhi, yet some very high state in </text>
<text top="456" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">Yoga perfection, based entirely on his inner feeling development and not at all on ideas and traditions. Gopi Krishna is </text>
<text top="469" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">an extremely honest reporter, to the point of humbleness. Since he does not claim great powers and achievements, one is</text>
<text top="483" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">even more willing to accept his detailed descriptions of inner changes as exact reports. Thus, one of the consequences of</text>
<text top="497" left="9" width="264" height="13" font="5">his autonomous training is the aliveness of his account.</text>
<text top="523" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">To understand the amazing unusualness of Gopi Krishna's account one might try to imagine in turn the feelings of an</text>
<text top="537" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">Indian Yogi reading the records of a Westerner, who, as a layman, reports about his strange encounters with God and</text>
<text top="551" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">Christ without the background of theological knowledge and discipline and yet trying to find his own way through the</text>
<text top="565" left="9" width="524" height="13" font="5">labyrinth of his emotions without the guidance of any psychology but with an old-fashioned body of religious</text>
<text top="579" left="9" width="193" height="13" font="5">concepts—a bewildering picture indeed.</text>
<text top="605" left="9" width="542" height="13" font="5">Lacking the guiding hand of a master, it is Gopi Krishna's fate to be thrown from one despair into another, hectic </text>
<text top="619" left="9" width="540" height="13" font="5">ups-and-downs, the daily bread of this sensational experience. Like Faust, Na Ro Pa and many others, he finds a </text>
<text top="633" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">solution several times in his life only at the point of death. Even commonplace events take on an enormous character </text>
<text top="647" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">and lead him into depressions and dangers almost to the point of ruination. His own analysis of that situation is that the </text>
<text top="661" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">awakened Kundalini went up into the Pingala instead of into the Sushumna where it rightfully belongs. Where does all </text>
<text top="675" left="9" width="547" height="13" font="5">this lead him? To constant light-awareness, shimmering halo-consciousness but interrupted repeatedly by years of </text>
<text top="689" left="9" width="91" height="13" font="5">relapse and illness.</text>
<text top="715" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">The comforting aspect of these often quite negative experiences is however that Gopi Krishna is never driven to pride, </text>
<text top="729" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">but remains aware of his own helplessness in front of the stunning events of his inner life. In best Indian tradition he </text>
<text top="743" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">does not ever feel himself to be the maker or creator of his own thoughts and feelings; he does not assume any false </text>
<text top="756" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">leadership in the course of his development but confesses to be nothing but a victim of positive and negative forces. He </text>
<text top="770" left="9" width="404" height="13" font="5">is buffeted by them and feels like a 'dumb and helpless witness to the show' (p. 151).</text>
<text top="796" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">All this proves that Gopi Krishna's is a typical explorer's mentality. Everywhere we meet a certain detachment, boldness,</text>
<text top="810" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">curiosity, independence and acceptance of everything that happens inwardly. He is equally interested in positive and </text>
<text top="824" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">negative events. Never do we find any anticipation of fixed results, but like one of the early alchemists he remains ready</text>

<text top="3" left="9" width="525" height="13" font="5">to accept the unexpected, even to explode, if this should be the result. He will go on anyway, come what may.</text>
<text top="29" left="9" width="539" height="13" font="5">One of the chief results of the publication of Gopi Krishna's experiments may well be a thorough overhauling of </text>
<text top="43" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">Sanskrit-English lexicography. In view of his detailed testimony it becomes clearly impossible to treat the whole realm </text>
<text top="57" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">of Kundalini-experi-ences as something belonging to the Western concept of either biology or psychology. The Indian </text>
<text top="71" left="9" width="534" height="13" font="5">concept of the Sukshma Sarira, which is after all the main subject of Gopi Krishna's reports, cannot possibly be </text>
<text top="85" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">translated into a Western vocabulary which, thus far, divides itself into the two fields of either <i>physis </i>or <i>psyche. </i>By now </text>
<text top="99" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">it is probably well-known that the formerly usual translations of Brahman with God and Atman with Spirit or Soul bar </text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">any possible understanding of Indian philosophy. It is as yet less known that the translations of Sukshma Sarira with </text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">subtle body, electric or astral body, are equally misleading. So are all other translations of this term into the vocabulary </text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="541" height="13" font="5">of Western anatomy, when reference is made to the spine and to the organs and glands of the physical body. The </text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="525" height="13" font="5">vocabulary of the Kundalini-Yoga-system refers neither to those facts which in the West are considered to be </text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">psychological nor to anything within the realm of the physical body as it is observed from the outside. The realm of </text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="544" height="13" font="5">inner body feelings, which are so elaborately described in Yoga texts, has never been adequately systematized by </text>
<text top="197" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">Western observers and has therefore never led to the creation of a vocabulary in Western languages which would make </text>
<text top="210" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">it possible to translate Indian texts pertaining to this field of experience. Only in the totally unscientific language of </text>
<text top="224" left="9" width="520" height="13" font="5">laymen do we occasionally have unsystematic attempts to describe this realm, particularly in cases of illness.</text>
<text top="250" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">Gopi Krishna himself is terribly handicapped by this lack in our English language and his elaborate descriptions should </text>
<text top="264" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">at last lead to a re-study of the Yoga vocabulary. It is particularly regrettable that modern Indian scholars in their often </text>
<text top="278" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">all too pointed eagerness to assimilate their own tradition to Western standards have as yet neglected to point out the </text>
<text top="292" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">incompatibility of these two voca-bularies and do, involuntarily, thus contribute to a genuine mis-understanding of </text>
<text top="306" left="9" width="29" height="13" font="5">Yoga.</text>
<text top="332" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">The author's own final conclusions, which he adds as a kind of afterthought in the last chapter, and which introduce the </text>
<text top="346" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">idea of evolution beyond man's present state and abilities, are strangely parallel to Sri Aurobindo's philosophy. This is </text>
<text top="360" left="9" width="523" height="13" font="5">understandable since they are both derived from the world of Tantra, which fascinates modern man so much, </text>
<text top="374" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">undoubtedly because of its secretiveness and of its being so hard to approach. Gopi Krishna gives us here an easy, quite </text>
<text top="388" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">novel and fascinating approach to one of the least-known and most frequently misunderstood aspects of India's great </text>

<text top="519" left="9" width="91" height="20" font="3">Chapter One</text>
<text top="552" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">ONE morning during the Christmas of 1937 I sat cross-legged in a small room in a little house on the outskirts of the </text>
<text top="566" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">town of Jammu, the winter capital of the Jammu and Kashmir State in northern India. I was meditating with my face </text>
<text top="580" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">towards the window on the east through which the first grey streaks of the slowly brightening dawn fell into the room. </text>
<text top="594" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">Long practice had accustomed me to sit in the same posture for hours at a time without the least discomfort, and I sat </text>
<text top="608" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">breathing slowly and rhythmically, my attention drawn towards the crown of my head, contemplating an imaginary lotus</text>
<text top="622" left="9" width="139" height="13" font="5">in full bloom, radiating light.</text>
<text top="648" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">I sat steadily, unmoving and erect, my thoughts uninterruptedly centered on the shining lotus, intent on keeping my </text>
<text top="661" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">attention from wandering and bringing it back again and again whenever it moved in any other direction. The intensity </text>
<text top="675" left="9" width="539" height="13" font="5">of concentration interrupted my breathing; gradually it slowed down to such an extent that at times it was barely </text>
<text top="689" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">perceptible. My whole being was so engrossed in the contemplation of the lotus that for several minutes at a time I lost </text>
<text top="703" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">touch with my body and surroundings. During such intervals I used to feel as if I were poised in mid-air, without any </text>
<text top="717" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">feeling of a body around me. The only object of which I was aware was a lotus of brilliant colour, emitting rays of light. </text>
<text top="731" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">This experience has happened to many people who practise meditation in any form regularly for a sufficient length of </text>
<text top="745" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">time, but what followed on that fateful morning in my case, changing the whole course of my life and outlook, has </text>
<text top="759" left="9" width="82" height="13" font="5">happened to few.</text>
<text top="785" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">During one such spell of intense concentration I suddenly felt a strange sensation below the base of the spine, at the </text>
<text top="799" left="9" width="526" height="13" font="5">place touching the seat, while I sat cross-legged on a folded blanket spread on the floor. The sensation was so </text>
<text top="813" left="9" width="548" height="13" font="5">extraordinary and so pleasing that my attention was forcibly drawn towards it. The moment my attention was thus </text>
</page>
<page number="4" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="842" width="595">
<text top="3" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">unexpectedly withdrawn from the point on which it was focused, the sensation ceased. Thinking it to be a trick played </text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">by my imagination to relax the tension, I dismissed the matter from my mind and brought my attention back to the point </text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">from which it had wandered. Again I fixed it on the lotus, and as the image grew clear and distinct at the top of my head,</text>
<text top="45" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">again the sensation occurred. This time I tried to maintain the fixity of my attention and succeeded for a few seconds, </text>
<text top="59" left="9" width="527" height="13" font="5">but the sensation extending upwards grew so intense and was so extraordinary, as compared to anything I had </text>
<text top="73" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">experienced before, that in spite of myself my mind went towards it, and at that very moment it again disappeared. I was</text>
<text top="87" left="9" width="541" height="13" font="5">now convinced that something unusual had happened for which my daily practice of concentration was probably </text>
<text top="101" left="9" width="57" height="13" font="5">responsible.</text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="530" height="13" font="5">I had read glowing accounts, written by learned men, of great benefits resulting from concentration, and of the </text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">miraculous powers acquired by yogis through such exercises. My heart began to beat wildly, and I found it difficult to </text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">bring my attention to the required degree of fixity. After a while I grew composed and was soon as deep in meditation as</text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">before. When completely immersed I again experienced the sensation, but this time, instead of allowing my mind to </text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="542" height="13" font="5">leave the point where I had fixed it, I maintained a rigidity of attention throughout. The sensation again extended </text>
<text top="197" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">upwards, growing in intensity, and I felt myself wavering; but with a great effort I kept my attention centered round the </text>
<text top="210" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">lotus. Suddenly, with a roar like that of a waterfall, I felt a stream of liquid light entering my brain through the spinal </text>
<text top="224" left="9" width="24" height="13" font="5">cord.</text>
<text top="250" left="9" width="513" height="13" font="5">Entirely unprepared for such a development, I was completely taken by surprise; but regaining self-control </text>
<text top="264" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">instantaneously, I remained sitting in the same posture, keeping my mind on the point of concentration. The illumination</text>
<text top="278" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">grew brighter and brighter, the roaring louder, I experienced a rocking sensation and then felt myself slipping out of my </text>
<text top="292" left="9" width="548" height="13" font="5">body, entirely enveloped in a halo of light. It is impossible to describe the experience accurately. I felt the point of </text>
<text top="306" left="9" width="540" height="13" font="5">consciousness that was myself growing wider, surrounded by waves of light. It grew wider and wider, spreading </text>
<text top="320" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">outward while the body, normally the immediate object of its perception, appeared to have receded into the distance </text>
<text top="334" left="9" width="542" height="13" font="5">until I became entirely unconscious of it. I was now all consciousness, without any outline, without any idea of a </text>
<text top="348" left="9" width="507" height="13" font="5">corporeal appendage, without any feeling or sensation coming from the senses, immersed in a sea of light </text>
<text top="362" left="9" width="542" height="13" font="5">simultaneously conscious and aware of every point, spread out, as it were, in all directions without any barrier or </text>
<text top="376" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">material obstruction. I was no longer myself, or to be more accurate, no longer as I knew myself to be, a small point of </text>
<text top="390" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">awareness confined in a body, but instead was a vast circle of consciousness in which the body was but a point, bathed </text>
<text top="404" left="9" width="346" height="13" font="5">in light and in a state of exaltation and happiness impossible to describe.</text>
<text top="430" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">After some time, the duration of which I could not judge, the circle began to narrow down; I felt myself contracting, </text>
<text top="444" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">becoming smaller and smaller, until I again became dimly conscious of the outline of my body, then more clearly; and </text>
<text top="458" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">as I slipped back to my old condition, I became suddenly aware of the noises in the street, felt again my arms and legs </text>
<text top="472" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">and head, and once more became my narrow self in touch with body and surroundings. When I opened my eyes and </text>
<text top="485" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">looked about, I felt a little dazed and bewildered, as if coming back from a strange land completely foreign to me. The </text>
<text top="499" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">sun had risen and was shining full on my face, warm and soothing. I tried to lift my hands, which always rested in my </text>
<text top="513" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">lap, one upon the other, during meditation. My arms felt limp and lifeless. With an effort I raised them up and stretched </text>
<text top="527" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">them to enable the blood to flow freely. Then I tried to free my legs from the posture in which I was sitting and to place </text>
<text top="541" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">them in a more comfortable position but could not. They were heavy and stiff. With the help of my hands I freed them </text>
<text top="555" left="9" width="486" height="13" font="5">and stretched them out, then put my back against the wall, reclining in a position of ease and comfort.</text>
<text top="581" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">What had happened to me? Was I the victim of a hallucination? Or had I by some strange vagary of fate succeeded in </text>
<text top="595" left="9" width="578" height="13" font="5">experiencing the Transcendental? Had I really succeeded where millions of others had failed? Was there, after all, really </text>
<text top="609" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">some truth in the oft-repeated claim of the sages and ascetics of India, made for thousands of years and verified and </text>
<text top="623" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">repeated generation after generation, that it was possible to apprehend reality in this life if one followed certain rules of </text>
<text top="637" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">conduct and practised meditation in a certain way? My thoughts were in a daze. I could hardly believe that I had a vision</text>
<text top="651" left="9" width="548" height="13" font="5">of divinity. There had been an expansion of my own self, my own consciousness, and the transformation had been </text>
<text top="665" left="9" width="544" height="13" font="5">brought about by the vital current that had started from below the spine and found access to my brain through the </text>
<text top="679" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">backbone. I recalled that I had read long ago in books on Yoga of a certain vital mechanism called Kundalini, connected</text>
<text top="693" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">with the lower end of the spine, which becomes active by means of certain exercises, and when once roused carries the </text>
<text top="707" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">limited human consciousness to transcendental heights, endowing the individual with incredible psychic and mental </text>
<text top="721" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">powers. Had I been lucky enough to find the key to this wonderful mechanism, which was wrapped up in the legendary </text>
<text top="735" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">mist of ages, about which people talked and whispered without having once seen it in action in themselves or in others? </text>
<text top="749" left="9" width="548" height="13" font="5">I tried once again to repeat the experience, but was so weak and flabbergasted that I could not collect my thoughts </text>
<text top="762" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">sufficiently enough to induce a state of concentration. My mind was in a ferment. I looked at the sun. Could it be that in </text>
<text top="776" left="9" width="521" height="13" font="5">my condition of extreme concentration I had mistaken it for the effulgent halo that had surrounded me in the </text>
<text top="790" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">superconscious state? I closed my eyes again, allowing the rays of the sun to play upon my face. No, the glow that I </text>
<text top="804" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">could perceive across my closed eyelids was quite different. It was external and had not that splendour. The light I had </text>
<text top="818" left="9" width="412" height="13" font="5">experienced was internal, an integral part of enlarged consciousness, a part of my self.</text>

<text top="3" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">I stood up. My legs felt weak and tottered under me. It seemed as if my vitality had been drained out. My arms were no </text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">better. I massaged my thighs and legs gently, and, feeling a little better, slowly walked downstairs. Saying nothing to my</text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">wife, I took my meal in silence and left for work. My appetite was not as keen as usual, my mouth appeared dry, and I </text>
<text top="45" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">could not put my thoughts into my work in the office. I was in a state of exhaustion and lassitude, disinclined to talk. </text>
<text top="59" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">After a while, feeling suffocated and ill at ease, I left for a short walk in the street with the idea of finding diversion for </text>
<text top="73" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">my thoughts. My mind reverted again and again to the experience of the morning, trying to recreate in imagination the </text>
<text top="87" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">marvellous phenomenon I had witnessed, but without success. My body, especially the legs, still felt weak, and I could </text>
<text top="101" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">not walk for long. I took no interest in the people whom I met, and walked with a sense of detachment and indifference </text>
<text top="115" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">to my surroundings quite foreign to me. I returned to my desk sooner than I had intended, and passed the remaining </text>
<text top="129" left="9" width="435" height="13" font="5">hours toying with my pen and papers, unable to compose my thoughts sufficiently to work.</text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">When I returned home in the afternoon I felt no better. I could not bring myself to sit down and read, my usual habit in </text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">the evening. I ate supper in silence, without appetite or relish, and retired to bed. Usually I was asleep within minutes of </text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">putting my head to the pillow, but this night I felt strangely restless and disturbed. I could not reconcile the exaltation of </text>
<text top="197" left="9" width="514" height="13" font="5">the morning with the depression that sat heavily on me while I tossed from side to side on the bed. I had an </text>
<text top="210" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">unaccountable feeling of fear and uncertainty. At last in the midst of misgivings I fell asleep. I slept fitfully, dreaming </text>
<text top="224" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">strange dreams, and woke up after short intervals in sharp contrast to my usual deep, uninterrupted sleep. After about 3 </text>
<text top="238" left="9" width="540" height="13" font="5">a.m. sleep refused to come. I sat up in bed for some time. Sleep had not refreshed me. I still felt fatigued and my </text>
<text top="252" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">thoughts lacked clarity. The usual time for my meditation was approaching. I decided to begin earlier so that I would not</text>
<text top="266" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">have the sun on my hands and face, and without disturbing my wife, went upstairs to my study. I spread the blanket, and</text>
<text top="280" left="9" width="228" height="13" font="5">sitting cross-legged as usual, began to meditate.</text>
<text top="306" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">I could not concentrate with the same intensity as on the previous day, though I tried my best. My thoughts wandered, </text>
<text top="320" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">and instead of being in a state of happy expectancy I felt strangely nervous and uneasy. At last, after repeated efforts, I </text>
<text top="334" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">held my attention at the usual point for some time, waiting for results. Nothing happened and I began to feel doubts </text>
<text top="348" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">about the validity of my previous experience. I tried again, this time with better success. Pulling myself together, I </text>
<text top="362" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">steadied my wandering thoughts, and fixing my attention on the crown, tried to visualize a lotus in full bloom as was my</text>
<text top="376" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">custom. As soon as I arrived at the usual pitch of mental fixity, I again felt the current moving upward. I did not allow </text>
<text top="390" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">my attention to waver, and again with a rush and a roaring noise in my ears the stream of effulgent light entered my </text>
<text top="404" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">brain, filling me with power and vitality, and I felt myself expanding in all directions, spreading beyond the boundaries </text>
<text top="418" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">of flesh, entirely absorbed in the contemplation of a brilliant conscious glow, one with it and yet not entirely merged in </text>
<text top="432" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">it. The condition lasted for a shorter duration than it had done yesterday. The feeling of exaltation was not so strong. </text>
<text top="446" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">When I came back to normal, I felt my heart thumping wildly and there was a bitter taste in my mouth. It seemed as if a </text>
<text top="460" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">scorching blast of hot air had passed through my body. The feeling of exhaustion and weariness was more pronounced </text>
<text top="474" left="9" width="128" height="13" font="5">than it had been yesterday.</text>
<text top="499" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">I rested for some time to recover my strength and poise. It was still dark. I had now no doubts that the experience was </text>
<text top="513" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">real and that the sun had nothing to do with the internal lustre that I saw. But, why did I feel uneasy and depressed? </text>
<text top="527" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">Instead of feeling exceedingly happy at my luck and blessing my stars, why had despondency overtaken me? I felt as if I</text>
<text top="541" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">were in imminent danger of something beyond my understanding and power, something intangible and mysterious, </text>
<text top="555" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">which I could neither grasp nor analyse. A heavy cloud of depression and gloom seemed to hang round me, rising from </text>
<text top="569" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">my own internal depths without relation to external circumstances, I did not feel I was the same man I had been but a </text>
<text top="583" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">few days before, and a condition of horror, on account of the inexplicable change, began to settle on me, from which, try</text>
<text top="597" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">as I might, I could not make myself free by any effort of my will. Little did I realize that from that day onwards I was </text>
<text top="611" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">never to be my old normal self again, that I had unwittingly and without preparation or even adequate knowledge of it </text>
<text top="625" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">roused to activity the most wonderful and stern power in man, that I had stepped unknowingly upon the key to the most </text>
<text top="639" left="9" width="539" height="13" font="5">guarded secret of the ancients, and that thenceforth for a long time I had to live suspended by a thread, swinging </text>
<text top="653" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">between life on the one hand and death on the other, between sanity and insanity, between light and darkness, between </text>
<text top="667" left="9" width="84" height="13" font="5">heaven and earth.</text>
<text top="693" left="9" width="533" height="13" font="5">I began the practice of meditation at the age of seventeen. Failure in a house examination at the College, which </text>
<text top="707" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">prevented me from appearing in the University that year, created a revolution in my young mind. I was not so much </text>
<text top="721" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">worried by the failure and the loss of one year as by the thoughts of the extreme pain it would cause my mother, whom I</text>
<text top="735" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">loved dearly. For days and nights I racked my brain for a plausible excuse to mitigate the effect of the painful news on </text>
<text top="749" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">her. She was so confident of my success that I simply had not the courage to disillusion her. I was a merit scholarship </text>

<text top="776" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">busied myself in reading irrelevant books borrowed from the library. Too late I realized that I knew next to nothing </text>
<text top="790" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">about some of the subjects, and had no chance whatever of passing the test. Having never suffered the ignominy of a </text>
<text top="804" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">failure in my school life, and always highly spoken of by the teachers, I felt crestfallen, pierced to the quick by the </text>

<text top="43" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">considerably senior to her in age, hailing from Amritsar, at that time no less than six days' journey by rail and cart from </text>
<text top="57" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">the place of her birth. Insecurity and lawlessness in the country had forced one of my forefathers to bid adieu to his cool </text>

<text top="113" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">vein in him, returned to the land of his ancestors when almost past his prime, to marry and settle there. Even during the </text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">most active period of his worldly life he was always on the look-out for Yogis and ascetics reputed to possess occult </text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="536" height="13" font="5">powers, and never tired of serving them and sitting in their company to learn the secret of their marvellous gifts.</text>
<text top="167" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">He was a firm believer in the traditional schools of religious discipline and Yoga, extant in India from the earliest times, </text>
<text top="181" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">which among all the numerous factors contributing to success allot the place of honour to renunciation, to the voluntary </text>
<text top="195" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">relinquishment of all worldly pursuits and possessions, to enable the mind, released from the heavy chains binding it to </text>
<text top="208" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">the earth, to plumb its own ethereal depths undisturbed by desire and passion. The authority for such conduct emanates </text>
<text top="222" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">from the Vedas, nay, from the examples themselves set by the inspired authors of the Vedic hymns and the celebrated </text>
<text top="236" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">seers of the Upanishads, who conforming to an established practice prevailing in the ancient society of Indo-Aryans, </text>
<text top="250" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">retired from the busy life of householders at the ripe age of fifty and above, sometimes accompanied by their consorts, </text>
<text top="264" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">to spend the rest of their lives in forest hermitages in uninterrupted meditation and preaching, the prelude to a grand and </text>

<text top="304" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">This unusual mode of passing the eve of life has exercised a deep fascination over countless spiritually inclined men and</text>

<text top="360" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">of the world. My father, an ardent admirer of this ancient ideal, which provides for many a refreshing contrast to the </text>
<text top="374" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">'dead-to-heaven and wed-to-earth' old age of today, chose for himself a recluse's life, about twelve years after marriage, </text>
<text top="388" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">his gradually formed decision hastened by the tragic death of his first-born son at the age of five. Retiring voluntarily </text>
<text top="402" left="9" width="546" height="13" font="5">from a lucrative Government post, before he was even fifty, he gave up all the pleasures and cares of life and shut </text>
<text top="416" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">himself in seclusion with his books, leaving the entire responsibility of managing the household on the inexperienced </text>
<text top="430" left="9" width="136" height="13" font="5">shoulders of his young wife.</text>
<text top="456" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">She had suffered terribly. My father renounced the world when she was in her twenty-eighth year, the mother of three </text>
<text top="469" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">children, two daughters and a son. How she brought us up, with what devotion she attended to the simple needs of our </text>
<text top="483" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">austere father, who cut himself off completely from the world, never even exchanging a word with any of us, and by </text>
<text top="497" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">what ceaseless labour and colossal self-sacrifice she managed to maintain the good name and honour of the family </text>
<text top="511" left="9" width="536" height="13" font="5">would make fit themes for a great story of matchless heroism, unflinching regard to duty, chastity, and supreme </text>
<text top="525" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">self-abnegation. I felt guilty and mortified. How could I face her with an admission of my weakness? Realizing that by </text>
<text top="539" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">my lack of self-control I had betrayed the trust reposed in me, I determined to make up for the lost opportunity in other </text>
<text top="553" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">ways. At no other time in my life should I be guilty of the same offence again. But in order to curb the vagrant element </text>
<text top="567" left="9" width="531" height="13" font="5">in my nature and to regulate my conduct it was necessary that I should make a conquest of my mind, which by </text>
<text top="581" left="9" width="537" height="13" font="5">following unhindered its own inclinations to the neglect of duty had brought me to such a sorry plight, a prey to </text>
<text top="595" left="9" width="264" height="13" font="5">poignant grief and remorse, fallen low in my own eyes.</text>
<text top="621" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">Having made the resolve, I looked around for a means to carry it into effect. In order to succeed it was necessary to have</text>
<text top="635" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">at least some knowledge of the methods to bring one's rebellious self into subjugation. Accordingly, I read a few books </text>
<text top="649" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">of the usual kind on the development of personality and mind control. Out of the huge mass of material contained in </text>
<text top="663" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">these writings, I devoted my attention to only two things: concentration of mind and cultivation of will. I took up the </text>
<text top="677" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">practice of both with youthful enthusiasm, directing all my energies and subordinating all my desires to the acquisition </text>
<text top="691" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">of this one object within the shortest possible period of time. Sick with mortification at my lack of self-restraint, which </text>
<text top="705" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">made me yield passively to the dictates of desire to substitute absorbing story books and other light literature for the dry </text>
<text top="719" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">and difficult college texts, I made it a point to assert my will in all things, beginning with smaller ones and gradually </text>
<text top="733" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">extending its application to bigger and more difficult issues, forcing myself as a penance to do irksome and rigorous </text>
<text top="747" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">tasks, against which my ease-loving nature recoiled in dismay, until I began to feel a sense of mastery over myself, a </text>
<text top="760" left="9" width="400" height="13" font="5">growing conviction that I would not again fall an easy prey to ordinary temptations.</text>
<text top="786" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">From mind control it was but a step to Yoga and occultism. I passed almost imperceptibly from a study of books on the </text>
<text top="800" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">former to a scrutiny of spiritualistic literature, combined with a cursory reading of some of the scriptures. Smarting </text>
<text top="814" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">under the disgrace of my first failure in life, and stung by a guilty conscience, I felt a growing aversion to the world and </text>

<text top="31" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">and quietude of a consecrated existence. At this time of acute mental conflict, the sublime message of the Bhagavad Gita</text>
<text top="45" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">had a most profound and salutary effect on me, allaying the burning mental fever by holding before me the promise of a </text>

<text top="73" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">way, from the original idea to achieve success in wordly enterprise by eliminating the possibility of failure owing to </text>
<text top="87" left="9" width="529" height="13" font="5">flaccid determination, I imperceptibly went to the other extreme: I was soon exercising my will and practising </text>
<text top="101" left="9" width="544" height="13" font="5">meditation not for temporal ends, but with the sole object of gaining success in Yoga even if that necessitated the </text>
<text top="115" left="9" width="174" height="13" font="5">sacrifice of all my earthly prospects.</text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">My worldly ambition died down. At that young age, when one is more influenced by ideals and dreams than by practical</text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">considerations and is apt to look at the world through golden glasses, the sorrow and misery visible on every side by </text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">accentuating the contrast between what is and what ought to be tend to modify the direction of thought in particularly </text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">susceptible natures. The effect on me was twofold: it made me more realistic, roughly shaking me out of unwarranted </text>
<text top="197" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">optimism based on the dream of a painless, easy existence, and at the same time it steeled my determination to find a </text>
<text top="210" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">happiness that would endure, and had not to be purchased at the cost of the happiness of others. Often in the solitude of </text>
<text top="224" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">a secluded place or alone in my room I debated within myself on the merits and demerits of the different courses open to</text>
<text top="238" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">me. Only a few months before, my ambition had been to prepare myself for a successful career in order to enjoy a life of</text>
<text top="252" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">plenty and comfort, surrounded by all the luxuries available to the affluent class of our society. Now I wanted to lead a </text>
<text top="266" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">life of peace, immune from wordly fervour and free of contentious strife. Why set my heart on things, I told myself, </text>
<text top="280" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">which I must ultimately relinquish, often most reluctantly at the point of the sword wielded by death, with great pain and</text>
<text top="294" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">torture of the mind? Why should I not live in contentment with just enough to fulfil reasonably the few needs imposed </text>
<text top="308" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">by nature, devoting the time I could save thereby to the acquirement of assets of a permanent nature, which would be </text>
<text top="322" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">mine for ever, a lasting ornament to the unchanging eternal self in me instead of serving merely to glorify the flesh?</text>
<text top="348" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">The more I thought about the matter, the more strongly I was drawn towards a simple, unostentatious life, free from </text>
<text top="362" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">thirst for worldly greatness, which I had pictured for myself. The only obstacle to the otherwise easy achievement of my</text>
<text top="376" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">purpose which I felt was rather hard to overcome lay in winning the consent of my mother, whose hopes, already blasted</text>
<text top="390" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">once by the sudden resolve of my father to relinquish the world, were now centred in me. She wished to see me a man of</text>
<text top="404" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">position and substance, risen high above want and able to lift her economically ruined family out of the poverty and </text>
<text top="418" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">drudgery into which it had fallen by the renunciation of my father, who had given away freely whatever my thrifty </text>
<text top="432" left="9" width="534" height="13" font="5">mother could save from their income, leaving no reserve to fall back upon in time of need. I knew that the least </text>
<text top="446" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">knowledge of my plans would cause her pain, and this I wanted to avoid at any cost. At the same time the urge to devote</text>
<text top="460" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">myself to the search for reality was too strong to be suppressed. I was on the horns of a dilemma, torn between my filial </text>
<text top="474" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">duty and my own natural desire to retrieve the decayed fortune of the family on the one hand, and my distaste for the </text>
<text top="487" left="9" width="91" height="13" font="5">world on the other.</text>
<text top="513" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">But the thought of giving up my home and family never occurred to me. I should have surrendered everything, not </text>
<text top="527" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">excepting even the path I had selected for myself, rather than be parted from my parents or deviate in any way from the </text>
<text top="541" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">duty I owed to them. Apart from this consideration, my whole being revolted at the idea of becoming a homeless ascetic,</text>
<text top="555" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">depending on the labour of others for my sustenance. If God is the embodiment of all that is good, noble, and pure, I </text>
<text top="569" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">argued within myself, how can He decree that those who have a burning desire to find Him, surrendering themselves to </text>
<text top="583" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">His will, should leave their families, to whom they owe various obligations by virtue of the ties He has Himself forged </text>
<text top="597" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">in the human heart, and should wander from place to place depending on the charity and beneficence of those who </text>
<text top="611" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">honour those ties? The mere thought of such an existence was repugnant to me. I could never reconcile myself to a life </text>
<text top="625" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">which, in any way, directly or indirectly, cast a reflection on my manhood, on my ability to make use of my limbs and </text>
<text top="639" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">my talents to maintain myself and those dependent on me, reducing me practically to the deplorable state of a paralytic, </text>
<text top="653" left="9" width="283" height="13" font="5">forced to make his basic needs the concern of other people.</text>
<text top="679" left="9" width="546" height="13" font="5">I was determined to live a family life, simple and clean, devoid of luxury, free from the fever of social rivalry and </text>

<text top="707" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">and reducing my needs, in order to have ample time and the essentially required serenity of mind to pursue calmly the </text>
<text top="721" left="9" width="547" height="13" font="5">path I had chosen for myself. At that young age it was not my intellect but something deeper and more far-seeing, </text>
<text top="735" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">which, building on the reverse suffered by me and triumphing at the end over the conflict raging in me, chalked out the </text>
<text top="749" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">course of life I was to follow ever after. I was ignorant at the time of the awful maelstrom of superphysical forces into </text>
<text top="762" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">which I was to plunge blindly many years later to fish out from its fearsome depths an answer to the riddle which has </text>
<text top="776" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">confronted mankind for many thousands of years, perhaps waiting for an opportunity, dependent on a rare combination </text>
<text top="790" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">of circumstances to come in harmony with modern scientific trend of human thought, in order to bridge the gulf existing</text>
<text top="804" left="9" width="545" height="13" font="5">between ingenuous faith on one side and critical reason on the other. I can assign no other reason for the apparent </text>

<text top="3" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">step I proposed to take in adopting an abstemious mode of existence, to strive for self-realization while leading a family </text>

<text top="31" left="9" width="489" height="13" font="5">in emulation of highly honoured precedent and in consonance with scriptural and traditional authority.</text>
<text top="57" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">We lived in Lahore in those days, occupying the top part of a small three-storied house in a narrow lane on the fringe of </text>
<text top="71" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">the city. The area was terribly congested, but fortunately the surrounding buildings were lower than ours, allowing us </text>
<text top="85" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">enough sun and air and a fine unobstructed view of the distant fields. I selected a corner in one of the two small rooms at</text>
<text top="99" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">our disposal for my practice and went to it every day with the first glimmer of dawn, for meditation. Beginning with a </text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">small duration, I extended the period gradually until in the course of a few years I was able to sit in the same posture, </text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">erect and steady, with my mind well under control and bent firmly on the object contemplated for hours without any </text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="545" height="13" font="5">sign of fatigue or restlessness. With hard determination I tried to follow all the rules of conduct prescribed for the </text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">students of Yoga. It was not an easy task for a college youth of my age, without the personal guidance of a revered </text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">teacher, to live up to the standard of sobriety, rectitude, and self-restraint necessary for success in Yoga, amidst the </text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">gaiety and glamour of a modern city in the constant company of happy-go-lucky, boisterous fellow-students and friends.</text>
<text top="197" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">But I persisted, adhering tenaciously to my decision, each failure spurring me on to a more powerful effort, resolved to </text>
<text top="210" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">tame the unruly mind instead of allowing it to dominate me. How far I succeeded, considering my natural disposition </text>
<text top="224" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">and circumstances, I cannot say, but save for the vigorous restraint I exercised upon myself for many years, curbing the </text>
<text top="238" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">impetuosity and exuberance of riotous youth with an iron hand, I think I should never have survived the ordeal which </text>
<text top="252" left="9" width="165" height="13" font="5">awaited me in my thirty-fifth year.</text>
<text top="278" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">My mother understood from my suddenly altered demeanour and subdued manner that a far-reaching change had taken </text>
<text top="292" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">place in me. I never felt the need of explaining my point of view to prepare her for the resolution I had taken. Reluctant </text>
<text top="306" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">to cause her the least pain, I kept my counsel to myself, avoiding any mention of my choice when we discussed our </text>
<text top="320" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">future plans, considering it premature, when I had not even completed my college term, to anticipate a contingency due </text>
<text top="334" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">to arise only at the time of selection of a career. But circumstances so transpired that I was spared the unpleasant task of </text>
<text top="348" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">making my determination known to my mother. I stood second in a competitive test held for the selection of candidates </text>
<text top="362" left="9" width="540" height="13" font="5">for a superior Government service, but due to a change in the procedure I was finally not accepted. Similarly the </text>
<text top="376" left="9" width="526" height="13" font="5">disapproval of my brother-in-law had the effect of annulling a proposal for my joining the medical profession.</text>
<text top="402" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">Meanwhile a sudden breakdown in my health due to heat created such an anxiety in the heart of my mother that she </text>
<text top="416" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">insisted on my immediate departure to Kashmir, attaching no importance to my studies when a question of my health </text>
<text top="430" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">was involved. Receiving at this juncture an offer of appointment to a low-salaried clerical post in the Public Works </text>
<text top="444" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">Department of the State, I accepted it readily with her consent and left for the beautiful valley, with no regrets, to take </text>
<text top="458" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">part for the first time in the mechanical drudgery of a small office. Within a year my parents followed me to Srinagar </text>
<text top="472" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">and soon after my mother busied herself in finding a matrimonial alliance for me. Next summer, in the twenty-third year</text>
<text top="485" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">of my life, I was joined in wedlock in the traditional manner to my wife, seven years my junior in age, belonging to a </text>
<text top="499" left="9" width="133" height="13" font="5">Pandit family of Baramulla.</text>
<text top="525" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">I startled her on our very first meeting by leaving the nuptial chamber at three o'clock in the morning for a bath under </text>
<text top="539" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">the copiously flowing water tap in the nearby riverside temple, returning after an hour to sit in meditation without a </text>
<text top="553" left="9" width="506" height="13" font="5">word until it was time to leave for work. She admirably adjusted herself to what must have seemed to her </text>

<text top="633" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">turned from the temple numb with winter cold. About a year after I was transferred to Jammu to serve my term in that </text>
<text top="647" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">Province. She followed me after a few months with my parents, to both of whom she endeared herself by her sense of </text>
<text top="661" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">duty and unremitting attention to their comfort. Years passed, not without lapses on my part and interruptions due to </text>
<text top="675" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">circumstances beyond my control; but I never lost sight of the goal I had set before myself and never swerved from the </text>
<text top="689" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">path I had chosen, decreed in this manner to prepare myself to some extent, without having the least knowledge of the </text>
<text top="703" left="9" width="200" height="13" font="5">crisis I had to face in the great trial ahead.</text>
<text top="729" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">At the time of the extraordinary episode in 1937,1 was serving as a clerk under the Director of Education in our State. </text>
<text top="743" left="9" width="537" height="13" font="5">Prior to that I had been working in the same capacity in the office of the Chief Engineer, from which I had been </text>
<text top="756" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">transferred for having the temerity to question an unjust directive from the Minister-in-charge, who often took morbid </text>
<text top="770" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">pleasure in bullying subordinates. I had no liking for the work in either office, although from the point of view of my </text>
<text top="784" left="9" width="528" height="13" font="5">other colleagues I held enviable positions. I was required to maintain the classified lists and service records of </text>
<text top="798" left="9" width="541" height="13" font="5">senior-grade employees, to formulate proposals for their promotion and transfer, to dispose of their petitions and </text>
<text top="812" left="9" width="520" height="13" font="5">appeals, and to attend to their requests. In this way I had to deal with a large section of the personnel in both </text>
</page>
<page number="9" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="842" width="595">
<text top="3" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">departments, many of whom, detecting chances of undeserved favours at the cost of unsuspecting fellow employees, </text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">frequented the offices regularly, hunting for easy gains, obliging colleagues to do likewise to save themselves from a </text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="64" height="13" font="5">possible loss.</text>
<text top="57" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">By the very nature of my duties it was utterly impossible for me to escape comment and criticism of my acts, which </text>
<text top="71" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">influenced the life and career of someone or other. But some of these acts had also the reverse effect of confronting me </text>
<text top="85" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">with my own conscience on behalf of a poor and supportless, but deserving candidate. Because of a desire to deal equal </text>
<text top="99" left="9" width="541" height="13" font="5">justice in all cases, I was frequently brought in conflict with hidden influences surreptitiously at work behind the </text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">apparently spotless façade of Government offices, which every now and then created insoluble problems and odious</text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">situations for me. I had a strange partiality for the underdog, and this trait in my character worked equally against my </text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">own interests, and on at least two occasions impelled me to refuse chances of promotion, out of turn, in preference to </text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="86" height="13" font="5">senior colleagues.</text>
<text top="181" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">Temperamentally I was not suited for a profession of this kind, but possessing neither the qualifications for another, nor </text>
<text top="195" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">means nor inclination to equip myself for a better one, I continued to move in the rut in which I had placed myself on </text>
<text top="208" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">the first day. Although I worked hard and to the best of my ability, I was more interested in the study and practice of </text>
<text top="222" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">Yoga than in my official career. The latter I treated merely as a means to earn a livelihood, just sufficient to meet our </text>
<text top="236" left="9" width="534" height="13" font="5">simplest needs. Beyond that it had no value or significance for me. I had a positive dislike for being drawn into </text>
<text top="250" left="9" width="543" height="13" font="5">controversies with crowds of disputing contestants on every side as happened almost every day, creating at times </text>
<text top="264" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">disquieting ripples in my otherwise placid mental pool, which I strove to keep unruffled and calm, indispensable to my </text>
<text top="278" left="9" width="74" height="13" font="5">Yoga practices.</text>
<text top="304" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">Only a few years after my joining the Public Works Department, clouds of intrigue began to gather round the then Chief</text>
<text top="318" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">Engineer, whose attempts to put a curb on the shady acts of corrupt officers landed him in difficulties, and a plot was </text>
<text top="332" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">woven round him by his subordinates in collusion with officials of the Ministry, all of whom had suffered deprivation of</text>
<text top="346" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">many wonted facilities at his hands. The conspiracy ended in his compulsory retirement from service much before his </text>
<text top="360" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">time amid expressions of amazement at such an act of injustice from those who were in the know of the affair. With his </text>
<text top="374" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">retirement I was left defenceless against a host of powerful and vindictive enemies who poisoned the Minister against </text>
<text top="388" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">me and resorted to devious ways to cause me harassment and harm. The last straw was furnished by my own criticism </text>
<text top="402" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">under the new Chief Engineer of a defective order received from the Ministry which, to my great relief, culminated in </text>
<text top="416" left="9" width="425" height="13" font="5">my transfer from a place whose atmosphere had become much too vitiated for my liking.</text>
<text top="442" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">In the Education Directorate the conditions were more reassuring for me. There were no chances of corruption on the </text>
<text top="456" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">scale that had existed in the Public Works Department. Consequently the distracting play of plot and counter-plot, which</text>
<text top="469" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">had been a regular feature of the former office, was also absent. Here my path ran more or less smoothly until 1947. It </text>
<text top="483" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">was in no small measure due to the sense of security and the congenial atmosphere in the new office that I was able to </text>
<text top="497" left="9" width="534" height="13" font="5">retain my link with it in spite of the ordeals I had to face and the suspense I had to bear for a long period, while </text>

<text top="610" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">I WAS born in 1903 in the small village of Gairoo, about 20 miles from Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir. It was the </text>
<text top="624" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">parental home of my mother, and she went to stay there at the time of my birth to have the care and attention of her elder</text>
<text top="638" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">sister and brothers during her confinement. My father had constructed a small, two-storeyed hut of his own in their big </text>
<text top="652" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">compound. It was a humble structure, built of sun-dried bricks with a thatched roof and served as our residence for a </text>
<text top="665" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">long time; for the years of my childhood and afterwards at intervals, whenever tired of the city we yearned for a breath </text>
<text top="679" left="9" width="68" height="13" font="5">of country air.</text>
<text top="705" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">My first faint recollections of childhood circle round a medium sized house in a quiet sector of the city of Srinagar. I can</text>
<text top="719" left="9" width="546" height="13" font="5">still recall a scene in which I was held tight in the arms of my oldest maternal uncle, who comforted me with soft, </text>
<text top="733" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">endearing words after a fit of prolonged weeping caused by the anger of my mother for having stayed out too long </text>
<text top="747" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">playing with the children. As I was the only son she never dressed me in fine clothes, to guard against the evil eye, nor </text>
<text top="761" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">allowed me long out of her sight for fear of mishaps. Another indelible childhood memory is of a moonlit night with my</text>
<text top="775" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">mother and one of my maternal uncles, sleeping on an open-from-the-sides but roofed top of a small wooden cabin, used</text>
<text top="789" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">as a granary, a common structure in rural habitations in Kashmir. We had travelled all day on horseback on the way to </text>
<text top="803" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">the distant abode of a reputed hermit, but failing to reach our destination at nightfall had sought shelter in the house of a </text>
<text top="817" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">farmer, who accommodated us thus for the night. I cannot recall the appearance of the saint, except that his long, matted </text>

<page number="10" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="842" width="595">
<text top="3" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">hair fell on his shoulders as he sat cross-legged against one of the walls of his small room directly facing the door. I </text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">remember him taking me in his lap and stroking my hair, which my mother had allowed to grow long in conformity with</text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="534" height="13" font="5">a solemn vow she had taken not to apply scissors or razor to it except at the time of the sacred thread ceremony.</text>
<text top="57" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">Years later, when I had grown intelligent enough to understand her, my mother revealed to me the purpose of her visit to</text>
<text top="71" left="9" width="543" height="13" font="5">the saint. She said that years before he had appeared to her in a dream at a most anxious time. She had passed the </text>
<text top="85" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">preceding day in an extremely perturbed frame of mind caused by my inability to swallow anything owing to a swollen </text>
<text top="99" left="9" width="545" height="13" font="5">and badly inflamed throat. In the dream the holy personage, of whose miraculous deeds she had heard astounding </text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">accounts from innumerable eyewitnesses, opened my mouth gently with his hand and touched its interior down to the </text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">throat softly with his finger; then making a sign to her to feed me vanished from sight. Awakening with a start, my </text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">mother pressed me close to her and to her immense relief felt me sucking and swallowing the milk without difficulty. </text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">Overjoyed at the sudden cure, which she attributed to the miraculous power of the saint, she then and there made a vow </text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">that she would go on a pilgrimage to his place of residence to thank him personally for the favour. Owing to household </text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">worries and other engagements she could not make the pilgrimage for some years and undertook it at a time when I was </text>
<text top="197" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">sufficiently grown up to retain a faint impression of the journey and the visit. The most surprising part of the story is </text>
<text top="210" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">that, as my mother affirmed afterwards repeatedly, the hermit, at the very moment of our approach after entering the </text>
<text top="224" left="9" width="538" height="13" font="5">room, casually inquired whether I had been able to suck and swallow my milk after his visit to her in the dream. </text>
<text top="238" left="9" width="473" height="13" font="5">Wonder-struck, my mother had fallen prostrate at his feet, humbly invoking his blessings upon me.</text>
<text top="264" left="9" width="545" height="13" font="5">I cannot vouch for the miraculous part of the episode. All I can say is that my mother was veracious and critically </text>
<text top="278" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">observant in other things. I have related the episode merely as a faintly remembered incident of early childhood. Since </text>
<text top="292" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">then I have come across innumerable accounts of similar and even more incredible feats, narrated by trustworthy, highly</text>
<text top="306" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">intelligent eyewitnesses; but on closer investigation the bulk of the material was found to be too weakly supported to </text>
<text top="320" left="9" width="579" height="13" font="5">stand the force of rigid scientific inquiry. For a long time I lent no credence to such stories, and I can emphatically assert </text>
<text top="334" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">even today that a real Yogi in touch with, the other world, capable of producing genuine psychical phenomena at will, is</text>
<text top="348" left="9" width="156" height="13" font="5">one of the rarest beings on earth.</text>
<text top="374" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">Another remarkable event of my childhood at the age of eight which I remember more vividly occurred one day as I</text>
<text top="388" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">walked along a road in Srinagar in early spring on my way to the house of our religious preceptor. The sky was overcast</text>
<text top="402" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">and the road -muddy, which made walking difficult. All at once, with the speed of lightning, a sudden question, never</text>
<text top="416" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">thought of before, shot across my mind. I stood stockstill in the middle of the road confronted within to the depths of my</text>
<text top="430" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">being with the insistent inquiry, 'What am I?', coupled with the pressing interrogation from every object without, 'What</text>
<text top="444" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">does all this mean?' My whole being as well as the world around appeared to have assumed the aspect of an everlasting</text>
<text top="458" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">inquiry, an insistent, unanswerable interrogation, which struck me dumb and helpless, groping for a reply with all my</text>
<text top="472" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">strength until my head swam and the surrounding objects began to whirl and dance round me. I felt giddy and confused,</text>
<text top="485" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">hardly able to restrain myself from falling on the slimy road in a faint. Steadying myself, I proceeded on my way, my</text>
<text top="499" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">childish mind in a ferment over the incident of which, at that age, I could not in the least understand the significance. A</text>
<text top="513" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">few days later I had a remarkable dream in which I was given a glimpse of another existence, not as a child or as an</text>
<text top="527" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">adult but with a dream personality utterly unlike my usual one. I saw a heavenly spot, peopled by god-like, celestial</text>
<text top="541" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">beings, and myself bodiless, something quite different—diffused, ethereal—a stranger belonging to a different order and</text>
<text top="555" left="9" width="543" height="13" font="5">yet distinctly resembling and intimately close to me, my own self transfigured, in a gloriously bright and peaceful</text>
<text top="569" left="9" width="520" height="13" font="5">environment, the very opposite of the shabby, noisy surroundings in which I lived. Because of its unique and</text>
<text top="583" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">extraordinarily vivid nature the dream was so indelibly imprinted upon my memory that I can recall it distinctly even</text>
<text top="597" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">today. The recollection of the scene in later years was invariably accompanied by a feeling of wonder at and a deep</text>
<text top="611" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">yearning for the exotic, inexpressible happiness enjoyed for a brief interval. The dream was probably the answer to the</text>
<text top="625" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">overwhelming, unavoidable question that had arisen from my depths a few days before, the first irresistible call from the</text>
<text top="639" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">invisible other world which, as I came to know later, awaits our attention close at hand, always intimately near, yet, for</text>
<text top="653" left="9" width="378" height="13" font="5">those with their backs to it, farther away than the farthest star in the firmament.</text>
<text top="679" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">In the year 1914 we journeyed to Lahore where my father was required to present himself personally at the Treasury to </text>
<text top="693" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">receive his pension. From that day to the time of my appointment in 1923 we lived there summer and winter. It was </text>
<text top="707" left="9" width="523" height="13" font="5">there that I received my high school and two years of college education, even at that young age oppressed by </text>
<text top="721" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">unfavourable and trying circumstances. We lived poorly and I had not the advantage of a private coach or guide; it was </text>
<text top="735" left="9" width="543" height="13" font="5">with great difficulty that my mother could find enough money to purchase even my essentially needed books and </text>
<text top="749" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">clothes. Denied the possibility of purchasing extra books, my study was confined to school classics, but I soon had the </text>
<text top="762" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">chance to read a slightly abridged translation in Urdu of the Arabian Nights at the age of about twelve, which I came </text>
<text top="776" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">upon accidentally in the house of my aunt. The book for the first time created in me a burning thirst for fairy tales, </text>
<text top="790" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">stories of adventure and travel, and other romantic literature which continued un-diminished for several years. At the </text>
<text top="804" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">age of fourteen, starting with easy stories, I turned from Urdu to English, devouring hungrily every story book and </text>
<text top="818" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">romance that came into my hands. From novels and other light material I gradually passed on to popular elementary </text>

<page number="11" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="842" width="595">
<text top="3" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">books on science and philosophy available in our small school library. I read avidly, my developing mind eager for </text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">satisfactory replies to the questions which cropped up as the result of my own survey of the narrow world in which I </text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">lived, and the stray glimpses of the broader one of which I came to know more and more from the graphic accounts </text>
<text top="45" left="9" width="111" height="13" font="5">contained in the books.</text>
<text top="71" left="9" width="534" height="13" font="5">I was brought up in a strictly religious atmosphere by my mother, whose faith rested unshakably on each of the </text>
<text top="85" left="9" width="545" height="13" font="5">innumerable gods and goddesses in her crowded pantheon. She used to go to the temple long before the first faint </text>
<text top="99" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">glimmer of dawn streaked the horizon, returning at daybreak to attend to the needs of the household, in particular to </text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">keep our frugal morning meal ready for me. In early childhood I followed implicitly the direction of her simple faith, </text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">sometimes to the extent of forgoing the sweet last hours of sleep towards dawn in order to go with her to the temple. </text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">With rapt attention I listened to the superhuman exploits of Krishna, which my maternal uncle read aloud every evening </text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="528" height="13" font="5">until almost midnight from his favourite translation of Bhagavad Purana, a famous book of Hindu mythology, </text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="535" height="13" font="5">containing the story of the incarnations of the god Vishnu in human form. According to popular belief, Krishna </text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">imparted the lofty teaching of Bhagavad Gita to the warrior, Arjuna, on the battlefield before the commencement of </text>
<text top="197" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">action in the epic war, Mahabharata. Wondering at the prodigious, supernatural feats of valour and strength recounted in</text>
<text top="210" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">the narrative with a wealth of detail, which carried my childish imagination into fantastic realms, I unquestioningly </text>
<text top="224" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">accepted every impossible and unbelievable incident with which the story abounds as truth, filled with a desire to grow </text>
<text top="238" left="9" width="209" height="13" font="5">into a superman of identical powers myself.</text>
<text top="264" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">The information I now accumulated from my high school texts and more extensively from the study of other literature </text>
<text top="278" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">acted as a cathartic and had the effect of purging my mind gradually of irrational and fantastic notions I had gathered in </text>
<text top="292" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">childhood, replacing them with a rational and realistic picture of the world. Occasionally, noticing an exact identity of </text>
<text top="306" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">thought between what I felt but could not articulate and the clearly expressed idea of a writer, I was so carried away by </text>
<text top="320" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">emotion that, dropping the book, I would stand up and pace the room for a while to compose myself before continuing </text>
<text top="334" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">to read. In this way my mind was moulded by degrees as much by my own inborn ideas about the nature of things, </text>
<text top="348" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">developed by the exercise of reason in the healthy atmosphere of literature, as by the influence of the great thinkers </text>
<text top="362" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">whose ideas I imbibed from their works. By the time I had completed my first year at college, the impact of the books, </text>
<text top="376" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">especially elementary treatises on astronomy and natural science to which I had access in the college library, as well as </text>
<text top="390" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">my ideas, formed or confirmed by continued study, had become powerful enough to start me on a path contrary to the </text>
<text top="404" left="9" width="541" height="13" font="5">one I had followed in childhood, and it did not take me long to emerge a full-fledged agnostic, full of doubts and </text>
<text top="418" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">questions about the extravagant notions and irrational beliefs of my own religion, to which I had lent complete credence </text>
<text top="432" left="9" width="115" height="13" font="5">only a few years before.</text>
<text top="458" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">Dislodged from the safe harbour which my mother's simple faith had provided for me, my still unanchored mind was </text>
<text top="472" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">tossed here and there, clinging to one idea for a time and then replacing it with another, found to be equally untenable </text>
<text top="485" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">after a period. I became restless and reckless, too, unable to assuage the fire of uncertainty and doubt lit by my own </text>
<text top="499" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">desultory studies. Without reading any standard book on religion or any spiritual literature to counterbalance the effect </text>
<text top="513" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">of the admittedly materialistic tendency of the scientific works I had gone through, I took up cudgels on behalf of the </text>
<text top="527" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">latter, wielding my weapons with such dexterity that in the college debates as well as in private discussion few adherents</text>
<text top="541" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">of the former could defend their points of view. Although until that time I had not studied religion or tried any method </text>
<text top="555" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">of direct spiritual experience, or acquired systematic knowledge of any science or philosophy beyond that provided by a </text>
<text top="569" left="9" width="529" height="13" font="5">few elementary volumes, the questions and problems which agitated my mind at that young age never found a </text>
<text top="583" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">satisfactory solution in any book on science, philosophy or religion. More intent on demolition than construction, I read </text>
<text top="597" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">ravenously until in my second year I began to neglect my prescribed studies to the extent of giving preference to the </text>
<text top="611" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">library over the classroom. I was brought to an abrupt halt by my failure in the college examination towards the end of </text>
<text top="625" left="9" width="533" height="13" font="5">1920. The shock demolished with one blow the seemingly invincible fortification of intellectual scepticism my </text>
<text top="639" left="9" width="226" height="13" font="5">immature judgment had created around myself.</text>
<text top="665" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">Instead of yielding or collapsing, I turned determinedly towards a path, actually aligned for me by nature, as it is at the </text>
<text top="679" left="9" width="537" height="13" font="5">moment for thousands of other men and women all over the world. I could not have visualized at that time what </text>
<text top="693" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">transpired afterwards, just as by no exercise of fancy can even an intelligent man form the least conception of what </text>
<text top="707" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">awaits one on the super-conscious plane. Deceived and disillusioned, I turned finally to the practice of Yoga, not as an </text>
<text top="721" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">expedient to save myself from the consequences of my own dereliction, but as a practicable method available to thirsty </text>
<text top="735" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">minds to verify individually the undemon-strable central truths of religion. When nothing tangible happened for nearly </text>
<text top="749" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">seventeen years, from the age of seventeen to thirty-four, I began to despair, at times led to doubt the method adopted </text>
<text top="762" left="9" width="202" height="13" font="5">and at others to suspect the whole science.</text>
<text top="788" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">Even after the change from the chaotic to the more or less spiritual trend of mind, the critical element in my nature never</text>
<text top="802" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">left me completely. I was not one to be satisfied with shadowy appearances and cloudy manifestations, with cryptic </text>
<text top="816" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">symbols and mystic signs. Flashes of light before the eyes followed by darkness, humming in the ears due to pressure on</text>

<text top="3" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">the tympanic membrane, peculiar sensations in the body caused by fatigued nerves, semi-hypnotic conditions resulting </text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">from protracted concentration, appearances and phantoms due to tricky imagination in a state of tense expectancy, and </text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">other similar phenomena had absolutely no effect on me. By continued practice I had no doubt acquired a high degree of</text>
<text top="45" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">proficiency in the art of keeping the mind in a state of fixity for a long time and in maintaining a condition of absorption</text>
<text top="59" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">for long periods without discomfort; but that in itself was not proof of supernormal development or evidence of success </text>
<text top="73" left="9" width="163" height="13" font="5">in the enterprise I had undertaken.</text>
<text top="99" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">Study of the scriptures and also of the literature of the other religions did not suffice to quiet the restless element in my </text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="530" height="13" font="5">nature or to appease the hungry spirit of critical inquiry. Stray passages from the teachings of prophets and the </text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="546" height="13" font="5">expressions of sages found an echo in the depths of my being without carrying conviction to my uncompromising </text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">intellect. The very fact that the existing world religions, descended from prophets or inspired sages, while tracing their </text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">origin to revelation from the Creator, differ radically in their cosmogony, mode of worship, observances, ritual, and </text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">even in some basic tenets was enough to raise serious doubts in my mind about the authenticity of the claim that the </text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">revealed material was a direct communication from God, the infallible source of all wisdom, and not merely the creation</text>
<text top="197" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">of more advanced brains in occasional touch with a higher but sometimes still fallible plane of consciousness. The total </text>
<text top="210" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">demolition by science in its very infancy of some of the citadels of antiquated religions, especially on the cosmogonical </text>
<text top="224" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">side, was sufficient in my view to expose the vulnerability of its other fronts as well to the attacks of its now robust </text>
<text top="238" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">opponent at any time. But science itself, though extremely useful in other ways and serviceable as a battering ram to </text>
<text top="252" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">smash religion, if not out of existence at least out of shape, was not in my view fit to rule the domain where faith holds </text>
<text top="266" left="9" width="545" height="13" font="5">sway. It had no satisfactory explanation to offer for my individual existence or for the infinitely complex creation </text>
<text top="280" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">around me. Confronted by a mystery, which grows deeper with the advance of knowledge, it was not yet in a position to</text>
<text top="294" left="9" width="438" height="13" font="5">be a source of illumination to one on issues admittedly beyond its present sphere of inquiry.</text>
<text top="320" left="9" width="538" height="13" font="5">I thirsted for rationality in religion, for the worship of truth, whatever and wherever that might be. There was no </text>
<text top="334" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">spectacle more painful for me than the sight of a conscientious and intelligent man defending an absurdity which even a </text>
<text top="348" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">child could see through, simply because it formed an article of his faith to which he must hold at any cost, even if that </text>
<text top="362" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">cost included the sacrifice of reason and truth. On the other side, the irrationality of those who attempted to squeeze the </text>
<text top="376" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">universe within the narrow compass of reason was no less deplorable. They were ignorant about the nature of their own </text>
<text top="390" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">consciousness. The unknown entity that inhabits human bodies is still enveloped in mystery, and the rational faculty, </text>

<text top="418" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">purely in terms of human experience, as interpreted by reason, is as irrational an endeavour to solve the riddle of the </text>
<text top="432" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">universe as it would be to judge the appearance of an object with the aid of a mirror which, for all we know, might be </text>

<text top="499" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">that would be as acceptable to the philosopher as to the peasant, and as welcome to the rationalist as to the priest. But </text>

<text top="569" left="9" width="525" height="13" font="5">kind of approach, even in the strictly temporal realm, much less the spiritual, there appears no possibility of a </text>
<text top="583" left="9" width="486" height="13" font="5">compromise between the two and consequently no likelihood of the efflorescence of a universal faith.</text>

<text top="3" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">That some, at least, of the manifestations were genuine there could be no doubt. But how were they to be accounted for?</text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="529" height="13" font="5">It was only after many years that I was able to locate the source of the bewildering phenomena and trace it to a</text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">marvellous super-intelligent power in man, which is both illuminating and mystifying—illuminating in the revealing</text>

<text top="99" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">My interest in the study and practice of Yoga was not the outcome of any deep desire to possess psychic gifts. The tricks</text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">and deception sometimes practised by men of this class, the exhortations against the exhibition and abuse of spiritual </text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="543" height="13" font="5">powers contained in the scriptures, and above all the utter futility of an effort useless as a means to secure lasting </text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">benefits either for one's own self or for other men were all, to my mind, sufficient reasons to rise above the temptation </text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">for acquiring the powers to flout the laws of Matter without possessing at the same time the necessary strength of will to</text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="548" height="13" font="5">obey the laws of the spirit. The emphasis laid in some of the books on Yoga, both of the East and the West, on the </text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">development of psychic powers merely for the sake of gaining success in worldly enterprise invariably made me wonder</text>
<text top="197" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">at the incongruity in human nature, which, even in the case of a system designed to develop the spiritual side of man, </text>
<text top="210" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">focusses the attention more on the acquisition of visible, wonder-exciting properties of the body or mind than on the </text>
<text top="224" left="9" width="215" height="13" font="5">invisible but tranquil possessions of the soul.</text>
<text top="250" left="9" width="538" height="13" font="5">The target I had in mind was far higher and nobler than what in the most attractive form I could expect, from the</text>
<text top="264" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">acquirement of the much coveted supernormal gifts. I longed to attain the condition of consciousness, said to be the</text>
<text top="278" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">ultimate goal of Yoga, which carries the embodied spirit to regions of unspeakable glory and bliss, beyond the sphere of</text>
<text top="292" left="9" width="578" height="13" font="5">opposites, free from the desire for life and fear of death. This extraordinary state of consciousness, internally aware of its</text>
<text top="306" left="9" width="548" height="13" font="5">own surpassing nature, was the supreme prize for which the true aspirants of Yoga had to strive. The possession of</text>
<text top="320" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">supernormal powers of the usual kind, whether of the body or mind, which kept a man still floundering in the stormy sea</text>
<text top="334" left="9" width="546" height="13" font="5">of existence without carrying him any nearer to the solution of the great mystery, seemed to me to be of no greater</text>
<text top="348" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">consequence than the possession of other earthly treasures, all bound to vanish with life. The achievements of science</text>
<text top="362" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">had brought astounding possibilities within the reach of man, possibilities no less amazing than what is related of even</text>
<text top="376" left="9" width="511" height="13" font="5">the most wonderful performances of the supernatural type with but one supreme exception—the miracle of</text>
<text top="390" left="9" width="534" height="13" font="5">transcendental experience and revelation, periodically vouchsafed to specially constituted individuals, which by</text>
<text top="404" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">accelerating ethical progress necessary for a peaceful and productive social order, has not only contributed the largest</text>

<text top="3" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">Our text opens with a classic example of the meditative technique. Whether for Eastern or Western psychology, the </text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">prerequisite of any human accomplishment is <i>attention. </i>The ability to concentrate consciousness is what we call in </text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">Western psychology a sign of ego-strength. Disturbances of attention can be measured by the association experiment </text>
<text top="45" left="9" width="548" height="13" font="5">which Jung developed to show how the ability of the ego to focus upon a relatively simple task (the association of </text>
<text top="59" left="9" width="246" height="13" font="5">words) can be impaired by unconscious complexes.</text>
<text top="85" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">The assiduous, prolonged discipline of attention to a single image (the full-blooming, light-radiating lotus) is as difficult</text>
<text top="99" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">as any concentration upon a learning task in an extraverted manner. Whether introverted or extraverted, whether Eastern</text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="537" height="13" font="5">or Western, we may note at the beginning the significance of the ego, that which focusses, concentrates, attends.</text>
<text top="139" left="9" width="547" height="13" font="5">The many-petalled lotus at the crown of the head is a traditional symbol of the Kundalini yoga. In the language of </text>
<text top="153" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">analytical psychology, the attention of the ego is fixed upon a self-image in mandala form. The ego has chosen its image</text>
<text top="167" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">according to the spiritual discipline, just as in Christian meditation there is the Sacred Heart, the Cross, the images of </text>
<text top="181" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">Christ, Mary, the Saints, etc. Rather than discuss the objects of concentration (comparative symbolism), let us note </text>
<text top="195" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">briefly in passing the difference of technique between <i>active imagination </i>and <i>yoga discipline. </i>In spiritual disciplines, as </text>
<text top="208" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">a rule, the attention is focussed upon already given or known images (in Zen Buddhism, there may be no images but a </text>
<text top="222" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">koan, a task, or a thing). In each case the focus of attention is prescribed, and one knows when one is wavering or 'off'. </text>
<text top="236" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">In active imagination as described by C. G. Jung, attention is given to whatever images or emotions, or body parts, etc., </text>
<text top="250" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">that 'pop into the mind'. Rather than suppressing the distractions, they are followed attentively. The method is half-way </text>
<text top="264" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">between the free-association of the Freudians, where one leaps freely from one image, word, thought to the next with no</text>
<text top="278" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">idea of the goal, and the traditional spiritual discipline of rigid fixity upon a given image. Active imagination develops a </text>
<text top="292" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">more personal psychological fantasy. (The lotus is after all a highly impersonal image which any adept anywhere could </text>
<text top="306" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">focus upon unrelated to his own personal psychological make-up. It is not 'his' lotus, but 'the' lotus.) Active imagination </text>
<text top="320" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">is concerned with the ego's relation with and personal reactions to the mental images. The emotional involvement with </text>
<text top="334" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">these images and their spontaneous reactions back are as important as the nature of the images themselves. If the quality </text>
<text top="348" left="9" width="534" height="13" font="5">of a free-association can be judged by its uninhibited-ness (lack of suppression) and the quality of a disciplined </text>
<text top="362" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">meditation can be judged by its unwavering fixity and undistractedness, the quality of active imagination can be judged </text>
<text top="376" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">by its emotional intensity, which intensity is given by the opposition between the ego position of the conscious mind </text>
<text top="390" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">and the various figures, images, and intentions of the unconscious psyche. Hence, it is called <i>active </i>imagination in that </text>
<text top="404" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">the ego not only attends, not only suppresses what does not belong (as in a spiritual exercise), but actively takes part in </text>
<text top="418" left="9" width="523" height="13" font="5">the drama or dialogue which unfolds by asking questions, experiencing emotions, pressing towards solutions.</text>
<text top="444" left="9" width="543" height="13" font="5">Furthermore, one aim of active imagination is often rather ex-traverted. I mean by this that one seeks through the </text>
<text top="458" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">meditation the counsel of inner figures concerning practical personal problems, whereas spiritual disciplines attempt to </text>
<text top="472" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">surmount (crown of the head) a world which gives rise to such personal problems and in which no permanent solutions </text>
<text top="485" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">can truly exist. In active imagination the counsel is sought not in terms of should I do this or that action, but rather what </text>
<text top="499" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">attitude is correct, what complex is constellated. Spiritual discipline on the other hand aims towards the divine and the </text>
<text top="513" left="9" width="201" height="13" font="5">transcendence of attitudes and complexes.</text>
<text top="539" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">He desires 'the surpassing state of pure cognition' for which meditation is the way. This goal contrasts sharply with those</text>
<text top="553" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">of analysis. Because the goals differ, the methods for achieving these goals follow different tracks. Thus the methods of</text>
<text top="567" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">free-association and active imagination are not paths to liberation or illumination in the traditional sense. Sometimes</text>
<text top="581" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">these differences are forgotten in depth psychology so that we expect more from its methods than described in its goals.</text>
<text top="595" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">Then free-association has behind it a hope of gaining one supreme curative revelation into the root trauma—the 'pure</text>
<text top="609" left="9" width="527" height="13" font="5">cognition' to set one free of neurosis. But methods of psychology do not lead to goals of yoga. After all, active</text>
<text top="623" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">imagination is not a method of pure cognition; to seek through it the transcendence of space and time with a prophetic</text>
<text top="637" left="9" width="513" height="13" font="5">insight into tomorrow is mistaken. The value and genuineness of an active imagination is proved neither by</text>
<text top="651" left="9" width="522" height="13" font="5">synchronistic events nor by uncanny break-throughs. Active imagination is a technique of self-regulation and</text>
<text top="665" left="9" width="423" height="13" font="5">circulation. It serves the aim of psychological connection with the archetypal dominants.</text>
<text top="691" left="9" width="524" height="13" font="5">The traditional goal of the sages is also to be differentiated from patho-psychological and para-psychological </text>
<text top="705" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">phenomena. Our author makes this quite clear. He would not be deflected by phantoms, by tricky light experiences and </text>
<text top="719" left="9" width="509" height="13" font="5">sounds. Nor would he be content with pre-cognitive visions and telepathic insights, nor even by achieving </text>
<text top="733" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">'wonder-exciting properties of the body or mind'. He aimed for the source of both natural and such supernatural events, </text>
<text top="747" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">to know with the knowledge that knows him and through which he knows (pure cognition), rather than being a freakish </text>
<text top="760" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">medium of that knowledge with an occult gift and helter-skelter access to it. To serve that knowledge he would have to </text>
<text top="774" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">know it, not be merely a victim of it. Therefore, there is such stress in his account on the theoretical structure of his </text>
<text top="788" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">experience. The knowledge of what is going on is as important as the events themselves. From this point of view it is </text>
<text top="802" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">not enough to call the source of these phenomena the unconscious, which means only that we are unconscious of their </text>
<text top="816" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">true background. Psychological accounts for him do not really give an account since the word 'unconscious' admits </text>

<text top="3" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">defeat of the cognitive drive. As he is not willing to rest with secondary phenomena of the spirit (occult powers, special </text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">sensations, sporadic enlightenment, etc.), so too is he not willing to accept secondary accounts of their origins. From his </text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">viewpoint the insufficiencies of our Western explanations (in terms of patho- and para-psychology) go hand in hand </text>
<text top="45" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">with inferior kinds of experience. These experiences and explanations would depict a Kundalini stirred but stuck, risen </text>
<text top="59" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">but not accomplished. For his traditional point of view, there flows from the pure cognition of accomplished Kundalini </text>
<text top="73" left="9" width="249" height="13" font="5">both adequate experience and adequate explanation.</text>
<text top="99" left="9" width="527" height="13" font="5">All of which should help us to remember the extreme importance of concepts and theory for the movement of </text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">psychological consciousness. The psyche needs a psychology that gives it room to move. It requires careful but intuitive</text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">thinking to support its adventures and give them sufficient frameworks. Psyche and psychology too closely reflect each </text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">other to have the radical development of the one without a corresponding theoretical radicalisation of the other. Where </text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">they fail to keep pace, we call those psychic events for which our theory is inadequate, 'alien', placing them in patho- or </text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">para-psychology. Furthermore, we call radical theories (like those of Kundalini yoga) 'mystical speculation' when the </text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">poverty of our psychic life fails to produce the empirical data on which the psychological theories have been erected.</text>
<text top="208" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">Again and again we shall come to passages in the text which emphasize the enormous <i>physical cost </i>of the experience. It </text>
<text top="222" left="9" width="538" height="13" font="5">is important to realize, and we can be grateful to our author for never letting this fact slip, that transformation of </text>
<text top="236" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">personality is exhausting. Consciousness alone consumes hundreds of calories a day, and the intensity of introverted </text>
<text top="250" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">discipline requires as much energy as extensive extraverted mental activity. Outstanding in the work as we go through it </text>
<text top="264" left="9" width="517" height="13" font="5">is the importance of the body. In spite of the seventeen long years of discipline, the author suffered a severe </text>
<text top="278" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">disorientation of consciousness. We cannot put this down to a neurasthenic constitution or a neurotic hypochondriasis. It</text>
<text top="292" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">is as if the one thing he did not expect was the degree of physical cost, the actual organic events. In this our author is a </text>
<text top="306" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">modern man, for it is the problem of us modern men to connect the body again with the spirit, rather than identifying </text>
<text top="320" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">spirit with soul or mind, to the detriment of body. The emphasis upon the body in what follows is nothing else than a </text>
<text top="334" left="9" width="362" height="13" font="5">description of the meaning of incarnation of the spirit in a modern example.</text>
<text top="360" left="9" width="537" height="13" font="5">From the personal, analytical point of view there are certain observations one could make concerning <i>the family </i></text>
<text top="374" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">constellation of the author which may have had some bearing upon the archetypal eruption. From the beginning there </text>
<text top="388" left="9" width="546" height="13" font="5">was a spiritual ambition. His old father led the way in this direction and our author's desire to prove himself to his </text>
<text top="402" left="9" width="500" height="13" font="5">mother is a dominant theme. He was the only son, carrying the psychological burdens from both parents.</text>
<text top="428" left="9" width="535" height="13" font="5">His own recollections of <i>childhood </i>bring out two facts which belong to his own 'personal myth'. The first is the </text>
<text top="442" left="9" width="528" height="13" font="5">experience of having almost died and having been saved by a wonder. The child-in-danger motif is part of the </text>
<text top="456" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">mythologem of the saviour-hero. It establishes chosenness; one has in childhood met the powers of darkness and been </text>
<text top="469" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">rescued from them by supernatural forces. The Gods single out at an early age those who are to carry consciousness </text>
<text top="483" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">further. The miracle of consciousness is frail at the beginning and can easily be snuffed out. Moses, Christ, Dionysius, </text>
<text top="497" left="9" width="218" height="13" font="5">Hercules are examples of the child-in-danger.</text>
<text top="523" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">As a child he had the experience of questioning himself in that utter overwhelming way that we find in the Buddha </text>
<text top="537" left="9" width="547" height="13" font="5">(when he was considerably older). Or, in modern times, Jung's description of his early years in his autobiography, </text>
<text top="551" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="6"><i>Memories, Dreams, Reflec-tions </i>iterates this motif of sudden devastating awareness. This same question lies at the root </text>
<text top="565" left="9" width="449" height="13" font="5">of all philosophy and it had the same shattering effect upon Descartes, but again at a later age.</text>
<text top="591" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">Gopi Krishna's early dream can be reduced in banal terms to a wish-fulfillment. He found in his dream a world 'the very </text>
<text top="605" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">opposite of the shabby, noisy surroundings in which I lived'. Yet how little this sort of interpretation tells us! It is a </text>
<text top="619" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">compensatory wish-fulfilment surely, but it transcends the personal. It is arche-typally compensatory, completing the </text>
<text top="633" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">world picture of earthly reality by an equally powerful reality of the unearthly. It is a wish-fulfilment not in the language</text>
<text top="647" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">of the world, but of a <i>'Weltanschauung'. </i>As such it is a statement: 'Look! You are not what you think you are. You are </text>
<text top="661" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">not only what your surroundings make you. There is more to reality than what is given socially and externally. You </text>
<text top="675" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">have another personality altogether different from the one you take for granted as &quot;you&quot;.' (I refer the reader again to the </text>
<text top="689" left="9" width="516" height="13" font="5">number one and number two personalities Jung writes of in his own life in <i>Memories, Dreams, Reflections.)</i></text>
<text top="715" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">It is therefore little wonder that with this archetypal background to his life (the father/mother constellation, being saved </text>
<text top="729" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">from early death, the childhood awareness of self, the dream-vision) that he could not read enough of symbolic, mythic </text>
<text top="743" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">material. <i>The Arabian Nights </i>and fairy tales connect personalities number one and number two. Fairy tales tell universal</text>
<text top="756" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">truths; they are archetypal accounts of how the personality meets and overcomes its own dangers. They speak in the </text>
<text top="770" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">language of symbols directly to the soul. The fairy tale is not a substitution for reality but is a necessary nourishment for </text>
<text top="784" left="9" width="134" height="13" font="5">the world of psychic reality.</text>
<text top="810" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">Lastly, in regard to the <i>author's personal psychology, </i>we find two further rather typical facts. The failed examinations </text>
<text top="824" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">cut Gopi Krishna off from a substitute career in which his spiritual aims could have become an intellectual or academic </text>

<text top="3" left="9" width="526" height="13" font="5">ambition. This sort of failure is often to be found in biographies of unusual people. It is signal, preventing the </text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">personality from developing along collectively approved lines. After the examination failure, there was only one way to </text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">go: his own. Failure as such does not give logic to this decision; rather the failure is symbolized into a parting of the </text>
<text top="45" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">ways, a fateful annunciation, so that it became clear to him what his call really was. The call was then finally announced</text>
<text top="59" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">in the author's thirty-fifth year, that is, at the midpoint of life, after having discharged his extraverted duties (education, </text>
<text top="73" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">work, parents, marriage, children, society) and the introverted obligations of the ego (to establish a living contact with </text>
<text top="87" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">the unconscious, the development of a subjective point of view, a <i>Weltanschauung}. </i>Too often in the West we fail to </text>
<text top="101" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">realize that even in Eastern disciplines the spiritual life is not meant as an escape from the worldly life. There is a karma </text>
<text top="115" left="9" width="540" height="13" font="5">to be fulfilled on earth, within the dharma of necessity. In fact, it would seem that the development of awareness </text>
<text top="129" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">requires a very solid basis in reality: an embodied personality in the daily world and an ego that can submit to its own </text>
<text top="143" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">unconsciousness. We can be grateful to our author for showing us in careful detail the ordinary outer context and inner </text>

<text top="255" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">THE sudden awakening of Kundalini in one whose nervous system has reached the ripe stage of development as a result</text>
<text top="269" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">of favourable heredity, correct mode of living, and proper mental application, is often liable to create a most bewildering</text>
<text top="283" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">effect on the mind. The reason for it, though extremely simple, may not be easily acceptable to the present-day intellect, </text>
<text top="297" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">which treats the human mind as a finally sealed product, dependent, according to some, exclusively on the activity of the</text>
<text top="311" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">brain cells, beginning and ending with the body; according to others, on the responsiveness of the bone-shielded grey </text>
<text top="325" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">and white matter to the extremely subtle all-pervading cosmic mind or Universal spirit; and according to still others, on </text>
<text top="339" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">the existence of an immortal individual soul in the body. Without entering into a discussion of the correctness of these </text>
<text top="353" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">hypotheses advanced to account for the existence of mind, it is sufficient for our purpose to say that according to the </text>
<text top="367" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">authorities on Yoga, the activity of the brain and the nervous system, irrespective of whether it proceeds from an eternal </text>
<text top="381" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">self-existing spiritual source or from an embodied soul, depends on the existence in the body of a subtle life element </text>
<text top="394" left="9" width="535" height="13" font="5">known as <i>prana, </i>which pervades each cell of every tissue and fluid in the organism, much in the same way that </text>
<text top="408" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">electricity pervades each atom of a battery. This vital element has a biological counterpart as thought has a biological </text>
<text top="422" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">complement in the brain, in the shape of an extremely fine biochemical essence of a highly delicate and volatile nature, </text>
<text top="436" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">extracted by the nerves from the surrounding organic mass. After extraction, this vital essence resides in the brain and </text>
<text top="450" left="9" width="543" height="13" font="5">the nervous system, and is capable of generating a subtle radiation impossible to isolate by laboratory analysis. It </text>
<text top="464" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">circulates in the organism as motor impulse and sensation, conducting all the organic functions of the body, permeated </text>
<text top="478" left="9" width="542" height="13" font="5">and worked by the super-intelligent cosmic life energy, or <i>prana, </i>by which it is continuously affected, just as the </text>
<text top="492" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">sensitive chemical layer on a photographic plate is affected by light. The term <i>prana, </i>as used by authorities on Yoga, </text>
<text top="506" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">signifies both the cosmic life energy and its subtle biological conductor in the body, the two being inseparable. At the </text>
<text top="520" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">very moment the body dies, the rare organic essence immediately undergoes chemical changes, ceasing to serve as a </text>
<text top="534" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">channel for the former in the previous capacity. Normally, the work of extraction of <i>prana </i>to feed the brain is done by a </text>
<text top="548" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">limited group of nerves, operating in a circumscribed area of the organism, with the result that the consciousness of an </text>
<text top="562" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">individual displays no variation in its nature or extent during the span of his life, exhibiting a constancy which is in </text>
<text top="576" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">sharp contrast to the continuously changing appearance of his body. With the awakening of Kundalini, the arrangement </text>
<text top="590" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">suffers a radical alteration affecting the entire nervous system, as a result of which other and more extensive groups of </text>
<text top="604" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">nerves are stirred to activity, leading to the transmission of an enormously enhanced supply of a more concentrated form</text>
<text top="618" left="9" width="536" height="13" font="6"><i>of prank </i>radiation into the brain drawn from a vastly increased area of the body. The far-reaching effects of this </text>

<text top="660" left="9" width="542" height="13" font="5">blood to the brain such as faintness, complete insensibility, excitement, irritability, or in extreme cases, delirium, </text>
<text top="673" left="9" width="77" height="13" font="5">paralysis, death.</text>
<text top="699" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">The awakening may be gradual or sudden, varying in intensity and effect according to the development, constitution, </text>
<text top="713" left="9" width="578" height="13" font="5">and temperament of different individuals; but in most cases it results in a greater instability of the emotional nature and a</text>

<text top="236" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">feeling of horror of the supernatural. I wanted to fly from even the thought of it. At the same time I felt a sudden distaste</text>
<text top="250" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">for work and conversation, with the inevitable result that being left with nothing to keep myself engaged, time hung </text>
<text top="264" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">heavily on me, adding to the already distraught condition of my mind. The nights were even more terrible. I could not </text>

<text top="306" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">through the spinal cord into the cranium gathered greater speed and volume during the hours of darkness. Whenever I </text>
<text top="320" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">closed my eyes I found myself looking into a weird circle of light, in which luminous currents swirled and eddied, </text>
<text top="334" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">moving rapidly from side to side. The spectacle was fascinating but awful, invested with a supernatural awe which </text>
<text top="348" left="9" width="233" height="13" font="5">sometimes chilled the very marrow in my bones.</text>
<text top="374" left="9" width="543" height="13" font="5">Only a few days before it had been my habit, when in bed at night, to invite sleep by pursuing a pleasant chain of </text>
<text top="388" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">thoughts which often led me, without revealing the exact moment when it happened, from the waking state into the </text>

<text top="581" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">substance in perpetual motion, flooding the brain and nervous system, without the intervention of the intermediary </text>
<text top="595" left="9" width="200" height="13" font="5">channels of the retina and the optic nerve.</text>
<text top="621" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">I seemed to have touched accidentally the lever of an unknown mechanism, hidden in the extremely intricate and yet </text>
<text top="635" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">unexplored nervous structure in the body, releasing a hitherto held up torrent which, impinging upon the auditory and </text>

<text top="663" left="9" width="538" height="13" font="5">unexpected feature in the normal working of the mind that gave to all my thoughts and actions the semblance of </text>
<text top="677" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">unreality and abnormality. For a few days I thought I was suffering from hallucinations, hoping that my condition would</text>
<text top="691" left="9" width="536" height="13" font="5">become normal again after some time. But instead of disappearing or even diminishing as the days went by, the </text>
<text top="705" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">abnormality became more and more pronounced, assuming gradually the state of an obsession, which grew in intensity </text>
<text top="719" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">as the luminous appearances became wilder and more fantastic and the noises louder and more uncanny. The dreadful </text>
<text top="733" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">thought began to take hold of my mind that I was irretrievably heading towards a disaster from which I was powerless to</text>

<text top="31" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">digestive and excretory organs. I lost my regularity and found myself at the mercy of a newly released force about which</text>
<text top="45" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">I knew nothing, creating a tumultuous and agitated condition of the mind as the sweep of a tempest creates an agitation </text>
<text top="59" left="9" width="140" height="13" font="5">in the placid waters of a lake.</text>
<text top="85" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">There was no remission in the current rising from the seat of Kundalini. I could feel it leaping across the nerves in my </text>
<text top="99" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">back and even across those lining the front part of my body from the loins upward. But most alarming was the way in </text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">which my mind acted and behaved after the incident. I felt as if I were looking at the world from a higher elevation than </text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">that from which I saw it before. It is very difficult to express my mental condition accurately. All I can say is that it </text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">seemed as if my cognitive faculty had undergone a transformation and that I had, as it were, mentally expanded. What </text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="536" height="13" font="5">was more startling and terrifying was the fact that the point of consciousness in me was not as invariable nor its </text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="546" height="13" font="5">condition as stable as it had been before. It expanded and contracted, regulated in a mysterious way by the radiant </text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">current that was flowing up from the lowest plexus. This widening and narrowing were accompanied by a host of terrors</text>
<text top="197" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">for me. At times I felt slightly elated with a transient morbid sense of well-being and achievement, forgetting for the </text>
<text top="210" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">time being the abnormal state I was in, but soon after was made acutely conscious of my critical condition and again </text>
<text top="224" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">oppressed by a tormenting cloud of fear. The few brief intervals of mental elation were followed by fits of depression </text>
<text top="238" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">much more prolonged and so acute that I had to muster all my strength and will-power to keep myself from succumbing </text>
<text top="252" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">completely to their influence. I sometimes gagged my mouth to keep from crying and fled from the solitude of my room </text>
<text top="266" left="9" width="339" height="13" font="5">to the crowded street to prevent myself from doing some desperate act.</text>
<text top="292" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">For weeks I had no respite. Each morning heralded for me a new kind of terror, a fresh complication in the already </text>
<text top="306" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">disordered system, a deeper fit of melancholy or more irritable condition of the mind which I had to restrain to prevent it</text>
<text top="320" left="9" width="538" height="13" font="5">from completely overwhelming me by keeping myself alert, usually after a completely sleepless night; and after </text>
<text top="334" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">withstanding patiently the tortures of the day, I had to prepare myself for the even worse torment of the night. A man </text>
<text top="348" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">cheerfully overcomes insurmountable difficulties and bravely faces overwhelming odds when he is confident of his </text>
<text top="362" left="9" width="537" height="13" font="5">mental and physical condition. I completely lost confidence in my own mind and body and lived like a haunted, </text>
<text top="376" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">terror-stricken stranger in my own flesh, constantly reminded of my precarious state. My consciousness was in such a </text>
<text top="390" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">state of unceasing flux that I was never certain how it would behave within the next few minutes. It rose and fell like a </text>
<text top="404" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">wave, raising me one moment out of the clutches of fear to dash me again the next into the depths of despair. It seemed </text>
<text top="418" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">as if the stream of vitality rising into my brain through the backbone connected mysteriously with the region near the </text>
<text top="432" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">base of the spine was playing strange tricks with my imagination. Also I was unable to stop it or to resist its effect on my</text>
<text top="446" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">thoughts. Was I losing my mind? Were these the first indications of mental disorder? This thought constantly drove me </text>
<text top="460" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">to desperation. It was not so much the extremely weird nature of my mental condition as the fear of incipient madness or</text>
<text top="474" left="9" width="390" height="13" font="5">some grave disorder of the nervous system which filled me with growing dismay.</text>
<text top="499" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">I lost all feeling of love for my wife and children. I had loved them fondly from the depths of my being. The fountain of </text>
<text top="513" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">love in me seemed to have dried up completely. It appeared as if a scorching blast had raced through every pore in my </text>
<text top="527" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">body, wiping out every trace of affection. I looked at my children again and again, trying to evoke the deep feeling with </text>
<text top="541" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">which I had regarded them previously, but in vain. My love for them seemed to be dead beyond recall. They appeared to</text>
<text top="555" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">me no better than strangers. To reawaken the emotion of love in my heart I fondled and caressed them, talked to them in </text>
<text top="569" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">endearing terms, but never succeeded in experiencing that spontaneity and warmth which are characteristic of true </text>
<text top="583" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">attachment. I knew they were my flesh and blood and was conscious of the duty I owed to them. My critical judgment </text>
<text top="597" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">was unimpaired, but love was dead. The recollection of my departed mother, whom I always remembered with deep </text>
<text top="611" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">affection, brought with it no wave of the deep emotion which I had invariably felt at the thought of her. I viewed this </text>
<text top="625" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">unnatural disappearance of a deep-rooted feeling with despondency, finding myself a different man altogether and my </text>
<text top="639" left="9" width="431" height="13" font="5">un-happiness increased at seeing myself robbed of that which gives life its greatest charm.</text>
<text top="665" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">I studied my mental condition constantly with fear at my heart. When I compared my new conscious personality with </text>
<text top="679" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">what it had been before, I could definitely see a radical change. There had been an unmistakable extension. The vital </text>
<text top="693" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">energy which lighted the flame of being was pouring visibly inside my brain; this had not been the case before. The </text>
<text top="707" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">light, too, was impure and variable. The flame was not burning with a pure, imperceptible and steady lustre as in normal</text>
<text top="721" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">consciousness. It grew brighter and fainter by turns. No doubt the illumination spread over a wider circle, but it was not </text>
<text top="735" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">as clear and transparent as before. It seemed as if I were looking at the world through a haze. When I glanced at the sky I</text>
<text top="749" left="9" width="541" height="13" font="5">failed to notice the lovely azure I used to see before. My eyesight had always been good and even now there was </text>
<text top="762" left="9" width="547" height="13" font="5">nothing obviously wrong with it. I could easily read the smallest type and clearly distinguish objects at a distance. </text>
<text top="776" left="9" width="537" height="13" font="5">Obviously my vision was unimpaired, but there was something wrong with the cognitive faculty. The recording </text>
<text top="790" left="9" width="375" height="13" font="5">instrument was still in good order, but something was amiss with the observer.</text>
<text top="816" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">In the normal man, the flow of the stream of consciousness is so nicely regulated that he can notice no variation in it </text>

<text top="3" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">from boyhood to death. He knows himself as a conscious entity, a non-dimensional point of awareness located more </text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="533" height="13" font="5">particularly in the head with a faint extension covering the trunk and limbs. When he closes his eyes to study it </text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">attentively, he ends by observing a conscious presence, himself in fact, round the region of the head. As I could easily </text>
<text top="45" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">discern even in that condition of mental disquietude, this field of consciousness in me had vastly increased. It was akin </text>
<text top="59" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">to that which I had experienced in the vision, but divested of every trace of happiness which had characterized my first </text>
<text top="73" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">experience. On the contrary, it was gloomy and fear-ridden, depressed instead of cheerful, murky instead of clearly </text>
<text top="87" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">transparent. It seemed as if prolonged concentration had opened a yet partially developed centre in the brain which </text>
<text top="101" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">depended for its fuel on the stream of energy constantly rushing upward from the reproductive region. The enlarged </text>
<text top="115" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">conscious field was the creation of this hitherto closed chamber, which was now functioning imperfectly, first because it</text>
<text top="129" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">had been forced open prematurely, and secondly because I was utterly ignorant of the way to adjust myself to the new </text>
<text top="143" left="9" width="65" height="13" font="5">development.</text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">For weeks I wrestled with the mental gloom caused by my abnormal condition, growing more despondent each day. My </text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">face became extremely pale and my body thin and weak. I felt a distaste for food and found fear clutching my heart the </text>
<text top="197" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">moment I swallowed anything. Often I left the plate untouched. Very soon my whole intake of food amounted to a cup </text>
<text top="210" left="9" width="545" height="13" font="5">or two of milk and a few oranges. Beyond that I could eat nothing. I knew I could not survive for long on such an </text>
<text top="224" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">insufficient diet, but I could not help it. I was burning inside but had no means to assuage the fire. While my intake of </text>
<text top="238" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">food was drastically reduced, the daily expenditure of energy increased tremendously. My restlessness had assumed </text>
<text top="252" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">such a state that I could not sit quietly for even half an hour. When I did so, my attention was drawn irresistibly towards </text>
<text top="266" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">the strange behaviour of my mind. Immediately the ever-present sense of fear was intensified, and my heart thumped </text>
<text top="280" left="9" width="456" height="13" font="5">violently. I had to divert my attention somehow to free myself from the horror of my condition.</text>
<text top="306" left="9" width="541" height="13" font="5">In order to prevent my mind from dwelling again and again on itself, I took recourse to walking. On rising in the </text>
<text top="320" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">morning, as long as I possessed the strength to do so, I left immediately for a slow walk to counteract the effect of an </text>
<text top="334" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">oppressive sleepless night, when, forced to lie quiet in the darkness, I had no alternative but to be an awed spectator of </text>
<text top="348" left="9" width="546" height="13" font="5">the weird and fearsome display visible inside. On the way, I met scores of my acquaintances taking their morning </text>
<text top="362" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">constitutional, laughing and talking as they went. I could not share their enjoyment, and passed them in silence with </text>
<text top="376" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">merely a nod or gesture of salutation. I had no interest in any person or in any subject in the world. My own abnormality</text>
<text top="390" left="9" width="546" height="13" font="5">blotted out everything else from my mind. During the day I walked in my room or in the compound, diverting my </text>
<text top="404" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">attention from object to object without allowing it to rest on one particular thing for any length of time. I counted my </text>
<text top="418" left="9" width="542" height="13" font="5">steps or looked at the ceiling or at the wall, at the floor or at the surrounding objects one by one, at each for but a </text>
<text top="432" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">fleeting instant, thus with all the will-power at my command preventing my brain from attaining a state of fixity at any </text>
<text top="446" left="9" width="294" height="13" font="5">time. I was fighting desperately against my own unruly mind.</text>
<text top="472" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">But how long could my resistance last? How long could I save myself from madness creeping upon me? My starving </text>
<text top="485" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">body was becoming weaker and weaker; my legs tottered under me while I walked, and yet walk I had to if I was to rid </text>
<text top="499" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">myself of the clutching terror which gripped my heart as soon as I allowed my mind to brood upon itself. My memory </text>
<text top="513" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">became weaker and I faltered in my talk, while the anxious expression on my face deepened. At the blackest moments, </text>
<text top="527" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">my eyebrows drew together into an anxious frown, the thickly wrinkled forehead and a wild look in my gleaming eyes </text>
<text top="541" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">giving my countenance a maniacal expression. Several times during the day I glanced at myself in the looking-glass or </text>
<text top="555" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">felt my pulse, and to my horror found myself deteriorating more and more. I do not know what sustained my will so that</text>
<text top="569" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">even in a state of extreme terror I could maintain control over my actions and gestures. No one could even suspect what </text>
<text top="583" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">was happening to me inside. I knew that but a thin line now separated me from lunacy, and yet I gave no indication of </text>
<text top="597" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">my condition to anyone. I suffered unbearable torture in silence, weeping internally at the sad turn of events, blaming </text>
<text top="611" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">myself bitterly again and again for having delved into the supernatural without first acquiring a fuller knowledge of the </text>
<text top="625" left="9" width="301" height="13" font="5">subject and providing against the dangers and risks of the path.</text>
<text top="651" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">Even at the times of greatest dejection, and even when almost at the breaking point, something inside prevented me from</text>
<text top="665" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">consulting a physician. There was no psychiatrist at Jammu in those days, and even if there had been one, I am sure I </text>
<text top="679" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">should not have gone to see him. It was well that I did not do so. The little knowledge of diseases that I possessed was </text>
<text top="693" left="9" width="541" height="13" font="5">enough to tell me that my abnormality was unique, that it was neither purely psychic nor purely physical, but the </text>
<text top="707" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">outcome of an alteration in the nervous activity of my body, which no therapist on earth could correctly diagnose or </text>
<text top="721" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">cure. On the other hand, a single mistake in treatment in that highly dangerous condition, when the whole system was in </text>
<text top="735" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">a state of complete disorder and not amenable to control, might have proved fatal. Mistakes were inevitable in view of </text>
<text top="749" left="9" width="287" height="13" font="5">the entirely obscure and unidentifiable nature of the disease.</text>
<text top="774" left="9" width="532" height="13" font="5">A skilled physician bases his observations on the symptoms present in an ailment, relying for the success of his</text>
<text top="788" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">treatment on the uniformity of pathological conditions in the normal human body. Physiological processes follow a</text>
<text top="802" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">certain specific rhythm which the body tries to maintain under all ordinary circumstances. In my case, since the basic</text>
<text top="816" left="9" width="537" height="13" font="5">element responsible for the rhythm and the uniformity was at the moment itself in a state of turmoil, the anarchy</text>

<text top="31" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">by the practice of meditation, had suddenly started to function with the object of reshaping my mind to make it fit for</text>
<text top="45" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">the expression of a more heightened and extended consciousness, by means of biological processes as natural and as</text>
<text top="59" left="9" width="534" height="13" font="5">governed by inviolable laws as the evolution of species or the development and birth of a child. But to my great</text>

<text top="101" left="9" width="413" height="13" font="5">about suddenly by the practice of Hatha Yoga, were fully known to the ancient adepts.</text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">I studied my condition thoroughly from day to day to assure myself that what I experienced was real and not imaginary. </text>

<text top="155" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">awake, I invariably studied my bodily symptoms to find corroboration for my mental condition. It would be a fallacy to </text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">assume that I was the victim of a hallucination. Subsequent events and my present condition absolutely rule out that </text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">possibility. No, the crisis I was passing through was not a creation of my own imagination. It had a real physiological </text>
<text top="197" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">basis and was interwoven with the whole organic structure of my body. The entire machinery from the brain to the </text>
<text top="210" left="9" width="547" height="13" font="5">smallest organ was deeply involved, and there was no escape for me from the storm of nervous forces which blew </text>

<text top="691" left="9" width="537" height="13" font="5">nerve-shattering experience. The learned authors confined themselves to the description of various postures and </text>
<text top="705" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">methods, all borrowed from the ancient writings on the subject. Few of them claimed to have had the experience but </text>
<text top="719" left="9" width="535" height="13" font="5">were eager to teach to others what they had never learned themselves. In some of the books there was a passing </text>
<text top="733" left="9" width="538" height="13" font="5">reference to Kundalini Yoga. A couple of pages or a small chapter was all that the authors thought sufficient for </text>
<text top="747" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">describing this most difficult and least known form of Yoga. It was stated that Kundalini represents the cosmic vital </text>
<text top="761" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">energy lying dormant in the human body which is coiled round the base of the spine, a little below the sexual organ, like</text>
<text top="775" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">a serpent, fast asleep and closing with her mouth the aperture of the <i>Sushumna, </i>the hair-like duct rising through the </text>
<text top="789" left="9" width="529" height="13" font="5">spinal cord to the conscious centre at the top of the head. When roused, Kundalini, they said, rises through the </text>
<text top="803" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="6"><i>Sushumna </i>like a streak of lightning carrying with her the vital energy of the body, which for the time being becomes </text>

<page number="21" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="842" width="595">
<text top="3" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">seventh centre in the brain. In the course of this process, the embodied self, freed from the bondage of flesh, passes into </text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="547" height="13" font="5">a condition of ecstasy known as <i>Samadhi, </i>realizing itself as deathless, full of bliss, and one with the all-pervading </text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">supreme consciousness. In only one or two writings were there vague hints of dangers to be met on the path. The nature </text>
<text top="45" left="9" width="435" height="13" font="5">of the danger and the methods to prevent or overcome it were not explained by the authors.</text>
<text top="71" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">From the vague ideas I had gathered from these works or picked up in the course of discussions or talks about Yoga, it </text>
<text top="85" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">was only natural for me to infer that the abnormal condition I had brought upon myself was the direct outcome of my </text>
<text top="99" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">meditation. The experience I was having corresponded in every respect with the descriptions given of the ecstatic state </text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">by those who had attained this condition themselves; there was therefore no reason for me to doubt the validity or the </text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">possibility of my vision. There could be no mistake about the sounds I had heard and the effulgence I had perceived. </text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">Above all, there certainly could be no mistake about the transformation of my own consciousness, the nearest and the </text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">most intimate part of me, that I had experienced more than once, and the memory of which was so strong that it could </text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">never be effaced or mistaken for any other condition. It could not be a mere figment of my fancy because during the </text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">vision I still possessed the capacity to make a comparison between the extended state of consciousness and the normal </text>
<text top="197" left="9" width="537" height="13" font="5">one, and when it began to fade, I could perceive the contraction that was taking place. It was undoubtedly a real </text>
<text top="210" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">experience, and has been described with all the power of expression at their command by mystics and saints all over the </text>
<text top="224" left="9" width="548" height="13" font="5">world. But in my case there was one particular and unmistakable deviation from the usual type of vision: the most </text>
<text top="238" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">extraordinary sensation at the base of the spine followed by the flow of a radiant current through the spinal column into </text>
<text top="252" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">the head. This part of the strange experience tallied with the phenomena associated with the awakening of Kundalini, </text>
<text top="266" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">and hence I could not be mistaken in supposing that I had unknowingly aroused the coiled serpent and that the serious </text>
<text top="280" left="9" width="528" height="13" font="5">disturbance in my nervous system as well as the extraordinary but most awful state I was in, was in some way </text>
<text top="294" left="9" width="81" height="13" font="5">occasioned by it.</text>
<text top="320" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">I made no mention of my condition to anyone save my brother-in-law, who came to Jammu during those days on a short</text>
<text top="334" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">business visit. He was many years older than I and loved me like a son. I talked to him unreservedly, aware of his deep </text>
<text top="348" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">affection for me. He had himself practised meditation for many years under the guidance of a preceptor who claimed </text>
<text top="362" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">knowledge of Kundalini Yoga. Frank and noble by nature, he often narrated to me his own experiences in the simple </text>
<text top="376" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">manner of a child, seeking corro-boration from me for the results he had achieved by his labours. Without the least </text>
<text top="390" left="9" width="548" height="13" font="5">pretension to knowledge, he gave me every bit of information he possessed, and thus in a way was instrumental in </text>
<text top="404" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">saving my life. My wife knew nothing of the life and death struggle in which I was engaged, but alarmed by my strange </text>
<text top="418" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">behaviour, lack of appetite, bodily disturbances, constant walks, and above all by the never-lifting cloud of anxiety and </text>
<text top="432" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">gloom on my face, she advised me again and again to consult a physician and constantly watched over me day and </text>
<text top="446" left="9" width="127" height="13" font="5">night, frantic with anxiety.</text>
<text top="472" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">My brother-in-law could not grasp the significance of what I related to him, but said that <i>his guru </i>had once remarked </text>
<text top="485" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">that if by mistake Kundalini were aroused through any other <i>nadi </i>(nerve) except <i>Sushumna, </i>there was every danger of </text>
<text top="499" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">serious psychic and physical disturbances, ending in permanent disability, insanity, or death. This was particularly the </text>
<text top="513" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">case, the teacher had said, if the awakening occurred through <i>pingala </i>on the right side of the spine when the unfortunate</text>
<text top="527" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">man is literally burned to death due to excessive internal heat, which cannot be controlled by any external means. I was </text>
<text top="541" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">horrified by this statement and in desperation went to consult a learned ascetic from Kashmir who had come to spend </text>
<text top="555" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">the winter at Jammu. He heard me with patience and said that the experience I had undergone could not at all be due to </text>
<text top="569" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">the awakening of the serpent power, as that was always blissful and could not be associated with any agency liable to </text>
<text top="583" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">cause disease or disturbance. He made another gruesome suggestion, heard from his teacher or picked up from some </text>
<text top="597" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">ancient work, to the effect that my malady was probably due to the venom of malignant spirits that beset the path of </text>
<text top="611" left="9" width="261" height="13" font="5">Yogis, and prescribed a decoction, which I never took.</text>
<text top="637" left="9" width="540" height="13" font="5">On the suggestion of someone I glanced through a couple of books on Kundalini Yoga, translations in English of</text>
<text top="651" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">ancient Sanskrit texts. I could not read even a page attentively, the attempt involving fixity of attention which I was</text>
<text top="665" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">incapable of maintaining for any length of time. The least effort instantly aggravated my condition by increasing the</text>
<text top="679" left="9" width="547" height="13" font="5">flow of the new born energy into the brain, which added to my terror and misery. I just glanced through the books,</text>
<text top="693" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">reading a line here and a paragraph there. The description of the symptoms that followed the awakening corroborated</text>
<text top="707" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">my own experience and firmly strengthened my conviction that I had roused the vital force dormant in me; but whether</text>
<text top="721" left="9" width="545" height="13" font="5">the agony of mind and body that I was passing through was an inevitable result of the awakening or whether I had</text>
<text top="735" left="9" width="520" height="13" font="5">drawn up the energy through a wrong nerve, I could not be sure. There was, however, one very briefly stated</text>
<text top="749" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">injunction—call it accident or divine guidance—I picked up from the huge mass of material in that very cursory glance.</text>
<text top="762" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">It was to the effect that during the course of the practice the student is not permitted to keep his stomach empty, but</text>
<text top="776" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">should take a light meal every three hours. This brief advice, flashing across my brain at a most critical moment when I</text>
<text top="790" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">hovered between life and death and had lost every hope of survival, saved my life and sanity and continues to do so to</text>
<text top="804" left="9" width="40" height="13" font="5">this day.</text>

<text top="3" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">At the time I paid no attention to this significant hint which, based on the experience of countless men, many of whom </text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">had probably lost their lives in the attempt to arouse the serpent, had come down through the ages as guidance for the </text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">initiates. Even if I had tried my hardest to do so, I could not have acted upon the advice at that time, as food was so </text>
<text top="45" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">abhorrent to me that my stomach revolted at the mere thought of it. I was burning in every part of my body while my </text>
<text top="59" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">mind, like a floating balloon, bobbed up and down and swayed sideways erratically, unable to keep itself steady even </text>
<text top="73" left="9" width="67" height="13" font="5">for a moment.</text>
<text top="99" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">Whenever my mind turned upon itself I always found myself staring with growing panic into the unearthly radiance that</text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">filled my head, swirling and eddying like a fearsome whirlpool; even found its reflection in the pitch darkness of my </text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">room during the slowly dragging hours of the night. Not infrequently it assumed horrible shapes and postures, as if </text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">satanic faces were grinning and inhuman forms gesticulating at me in the blackness. This happened night after night for </text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">months, weakening my will and sapping my resistance until I felt unable to endure the fearful ordeal any longer, certain </text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">that at any moment I might succumb to the relentlessly pursuing horror and, bidding farewell to my life and sanity, rush </text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">out of the room a raving maniac. But I persisted, determined to hold on as long as I had a vestige of will power, resolved</text>
<text top="197" left="9" width="517" height="13" font="5">at the first sign of breaking to surrender my life rather than lose myself in the ghastly wilderness of insanity.</text>
<text top="222" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">When it was day I longed for the night and during the night I fervently prayed for the day. As the time wore on, my </text>
<text top="236" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">hope dwindled and desperation seized me. There was no relaxation in the tension or any abatement in the ceaselessly </text>
<text top="250" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">haunting fear or any relief from the fiery stream that darted through my nerves and poured into my agonized brain. On </text>
<text top="264" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">the other hand, as my vitality ebbed as a result of fasts, and my resistance weakened, the malady was aggravated to such </text>
<text top="278" left="9" width="218" height="13" font="5">a pitch that every moment I expected the end.</text>
<text top="304" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">It was in such a frame of mind that the holy festival of Shivratri or the night of Shiva, came to pass towards the end of </text>
<text top="318" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">February. As usual every year my wife had prepared painstakingly some dainty dishes on the day and gently insisted </text>
<text top="332" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">that I, too, should partake of the food. Not to disappoint her and cast a cloud of gloom on her already anxiety-filled </text>
<text top="346" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">mind, I acquiesced and forcibly swallowed a few morsels, then gave up and washed my hands. Immediately I felt a </text>
<text top="360" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">sinking sensation at the pit of my stomach, a fiery stream of energy shot into my head, and I felt myself lifted up and up,</text>
<text top="374" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">expanding awfully with unbearable terror clutching at me from every side. I felt a reeling sensation while my hands and </text>
<text top="388" left="9" width="546" height="13" font="5">feet grew cold as ice, as if all the heat had escaped from them to feed the fiery vapour in the head which had risen </text>
<text top="402" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">through the cord like the ruddy blast from a furnace and now, acting like a poison on the brain, struck me numb. I was </text>
<text top="416" left="9" width="194" height="13" font="5">overpowered by faintness and giddiness.</text>
<text top="442" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">I staggered to my feet and dragged myself heavily towards my bed in the adjacent room. With trembling hands I lifted </text>
<text top="456" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">up the cover and slipped in, trying to stretch myself into a position of ease. But I was in a terrible condition, burning </text>
<text top="469" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">internally from head to toes, outwardly cold as ice, and shivering as if stricken with ague. I felt my pulse; it was racing </text>
<text top="483" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">madly and my heart was thumping wildly below my ribs, its pounding distinctly audible to me. But what horrified me </text>
<text top="497" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">was the intensity of the fiery currents that now darted through my body, penetrating into every part and every organ. My</text>
<text top="511" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">brain worked desperately, unable to give coherence to my frenzied thoughts. To call in a doctor for consultation in such </text>
<text top="525" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">an unheard of disease would be a mere waste of effort. His first thought on hearing of my symptoms would turn to a </text>
<text top="539" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">lunatic asylum. It would be futile on my part to seek help from any other quarter for such an affliction. What could I do </text>
<text top="553" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">then to save myself from this torture? Could it be that in my previous semi-starved condition, subsisting only on a few </text>
<text top="567" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">oranges and a little milk, the fiery current could not attain such awful intensity as it had done now with the entry of solid</text>
<text top="581" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">food in my stomach? How could I save myself? Where could I go to escape from the furnace raging in my interior?</text>
<text top="607" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">The heat grew every moment, causing such unbearable pain that I writhed and twisted from side to side while streams of</text>
<text top="621" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">cold perspiration poured down my face and limbs. But still the heat increased and soon it seemed as if innumerable </text>
<text top="635" left="9" width="533" height="13" font="5">red-hot pins were coursing through my body, scorching and blistering the organs and tissues like flying sparks. </text>
<text top="649" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">Suffering the most excruciating torture, I clenched my hands and bit my lips to stop myself from leaping out of bed and </text>
<text top="663" left="9" width="548" height="13" font="5">crying at the top of my voice. The throbbing of my heart grew more and more terrific, acquiring such a spasmodic </text>
<text top="677" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">violence that I thought it must either stop beating or burst. Flesh and blood could not stand such strain without giving </text>
<text top="691" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">way any moment. It was easy to see that the body was valiantly trying to fight the virulent poison speeding across the </text>
<text top="705" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">nerves and pouring into the brain. But the fight was so unequal and the fury let loose in my system so lethal that there </text>
<text top="719" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">could be not the least doubt about the outcome. There were dreadful disturbances in all the organs, each so alarming and</text>
<text top="733" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">painful that I wonder how I managed to retain my self-possession under the onslaught. The whole delicate organism was</text>
<text top="747" left="9" width="400" height="13" font="5">burning, withering away completely under the fiery blast racing through its interior.</text>
<text top="772" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">I knew I was dying and that my heart could not stand the tremendous strain for long. My throat was scorched and every </text>
<text top="786" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">part of my body naming and burning, but I could do nothing to alleviate the dreadful suffering. If a well or river had </text>
<text top="800" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">been near I would have jumped into its cold depths, preferring death to what I was undergoing. But there was no well </text>
<text top="814" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">and the river was half a mile away. With a great effort I got up, trembling, with the idea of pouring a few buckets of cold</text>

<page number="23" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="842" width="595">
<text top="3" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">water over my head to abate the dreadful heat. But at that moment my eyes fell on my small daughter, Ragina, lying in </text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">the next bed awake, watching my feverish movements with wide-open anxious eyes. With the remnant of sense still left </text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="547" height="13" font="5">in me I could understand that the least unusual movement on my part at that time would make her cry and that if I </text>
<text top="45" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">started to pour water over my body at such an unearthly hour, both she and her mother, who was busy in the kitchen, </text>
<text top="59" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">would almost die with fright. The thought restrained me and I decided to bear the internal agony until the end, which </text>
<text top="73" left="9" width="95" height="13" font="5">could not be far off.</text>
<text top="99" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">What had happened to me all of a sudden? What devilish power of the underworld held me in its relentless grasp? Was I</text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="542" height="13" font="5">doomed to die in this dreadful way, leaving a corpse with blackened face and limbs to make people wonder what </text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">unheard-of horror had overtaken me as a punishment for crimes committed in a previous birth? I racked my distracted </text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">brain for a way of escape, only to meet blank despair on every side. The effort exhausted me and I felt myself sinking, </text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">dully conscious of the scalding sea of pain in which I was drowning. I tried desperately to rouse myself, only to sink </text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">back again, deadened by a torment beyond my power to endure. After a while with a sudden, inexplicable revival of </text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">strength, marking the onset of delirium, I came back to life with a shred of sanity left, Almighty alone knows how, just </text>
<text top="197" left="9" width="431" height="13" font="5">sufficient to prevent me from giving way completely to acts of madness and self-violence.</text>
<text top="222" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">Pulling the cover over my face, I stretched myself to my full length on the bed, burning in every fibre, lashed as it were </text>
<text top="236" left="9" width="546" height="13" font="5">by a fiery rain of red-hot needles piercing my skin. At this moment a fearful idea struck me. Could it be that I had </text>
<text top="250" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">aroused Kundalini through <i>pingala </i>or the solar nerve which regulates the flow of heat in the body and is located on the </text>
<text top="264" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">right side of <i>Sushumna'? </i>If so, I was doomed, I thought desperately and as if by divine dispensation the idea flashed </text>
<text top="278" left="9" width="527" height="13" font="5">across my brain to make a last-minute attempt to rouse <i>Ida, </i>or the lunar nerve on the left side, to activity, thus </text>
<text top="292" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">neutralizing the dreadful burning effect of the devouring fire within. With my mind reeling and senses deadened with </text>
<text top="306" left="9" width="543" height="13" font="5">pain, but with all the will-power left at my command, I brought my attention to bear on the left side of the seat of </text>
<text top="320" left="9" width="520" height="13" font="5">Kundalini, and tried to force an imaginary cold current upward through the middle of the spinal cord. In that </text>
<text top="334" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">extraordinarily extended, agonized, and exhausted state of consciousness, I distinctly felt the location of the nerve and </text>
<text top="348" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">strained hard mentally to divert its flow into the central channel. Then, as if waiting for the destined moment, a miracle </text>

<text top="388" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">There was a sound like a nerve thread snapping and instantaneously a silvery streak passed zigzag through the spinal </text>
<text top="402" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">cord, exactly like the sinuous movement of a white serpent in rapid flight, pouring an effulgent, cascading shower of </text>
<text top="416" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">brilliant vital energy into my brain, filling my head with a blissful lustre in place of the flame that had been tormenting </text>
<text top="430" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">me for the last three hours. Completely taken by surprise at this sudden transformation of the fiery current, darting </text>
<text top="444" left="9" width="540" height="13" font="5">across the entire network of my nerves only a moment before, and overjoyed at the cessation of pain, I remained </text>
<text top="458" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">absolutely quiet and motionless for some time, tasting the bliss of relief with a mind flooded with emotion, unable to </text>
<text top="472" left="9" width="539" height="13" font="5">believe I was really free of the horror. Tortured and exhausted almost to the point of collapse by the agony I had </text>
<text top="485" left="9" width="542" height="13" font="5">suffered during the terrible interval. I immediately fell asleep, bathed in light and for the first time after weeks of </text>
<text top="499" left="9" width="224" height="13" font="5">anguish felt the sweet embrace of restful sleep.</text>
<text top="525" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">As if rudely shaken out of my slumber I awoke after about an hour. The stream of lustre was still pouring in my head, </text>
<text top="539" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">my brain was clear, my heart and pulse had stopped racing, the burning sensations and the fear had almost vanished; but</text>
<text top="553" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">my throat was still dry, my mouth parched, and I found myself in a state of extreme exhaustion, as if every ounce of </text>
<text top="567" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">energy had been drained out of me. Exactly at that moment another idea occurred to me; as if suggested by an invisible </text>
<text top="581" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">intelligence, and with irresistible power came the direction that I should eat something immediately. I motioned to my </text>
<text top="595" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">wife, who as usual was lying awake in her bed anxiously watching my every movement, to fetch me a cup of milk and a </text>
<text top="609" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">little bread. Taken aback by this unusual and untimely request, she hesitated a moment, and then complied without a </text>
<text top="623" left="9" width="528" height="13" font="5">word. I ate the bread, swallowing it with difficulty with the help of the milk and immediately fell asleep again.</text>
<text top="649" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">I woke up again after about two hours, considerably refreshed by the sleep. My head was still filled with the glowing </text>
<text top="663" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">radiance and, to my surprise, in this heightened and lustrous state of consciousness I could distinctly perceive a tongue </text>
<text top="677" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">of the golden flame searching my stomach for food and moving round along the nerves lining it. I took a few bites of </text>
<text top="691" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">bread and another cup of milk, and as soon as I had done so I found the halo in the head contracting and a larger tongue </text>
<text top="705" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">of flame licking my stomach, as if a part of the streaming energy pouring into my brain was being diverted to the gastric</text>
<text top="719" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">region to expedite the process of digestion. I lay awake, dumb with wonder, watching this living radiance moving from </text>
<text top="733" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">place to place through the whole digestive tract, caressing the intestines and the liver, while another stream poured into </text>
<text top="747" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">the kidneys and the heart. I pinched myself to make sure whether I was dreaming or asleep, absolutely dumbfounded by </text>
<text top="760" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">what I was witnessing in my own body, entirely powerless to regulate or to guide the current. Unlike the horror I had </text>
<text top="774" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">experienced before, I felt no discomfort now; all that I could feel was a gentle and soothing warmth moving through my </text>
<text top="788" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">body as the current travelled from point to point. I watched this wonderful play silently, my whole being filled with </text>
<text top="802" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">boundless gratitude to the Unseen for this timely deliverance from a dreadful fate; and a new assurance began to shape </text>
<text top="816" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">itself in my mind that the serpent fire was in reality now at work in my exhausted and agonized body; and that I was </text>

<text top="69" left="9" width="298" height="20" font="9"><i>Commentary to Chapters Three and Four</i></text>
<text top="102" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">We encounter here a term central to the theories which Gopi Krishna discusses more fully later. This term is <i>prana. </i>He </text>
<text top="115" left="9" width="531" height="13" font="5">defines it as a subtle life element and compares it to a fluid and to electricity. He further gives it a materialistic </text>
<text top="129" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">description: 'an extremely fine biochemical essence of a highly delicate and volatile nature, extracted by the nerves from</text>
<text top="143" left="9" width="540" height="13" font="5">the surrounding organic mass. After extraction, this vital essence resides in the brain and the nervous system... it </text>
<text top="157" left="9" width="281" height="13" font="5">circulates in the organism as motor impulse and sensation'.</text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">It would take us far afield to discuss in an adequate way the comparable ideas in Western psychology. I have already </text>
<text top="197" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">given some attention to the history of the idea of <i>psychic energy </i>as a circulating flow within the organism in Chapter Six</text>
<text top="211" left="9" width="102" height="13" font="5">of my book <i>Emotion.</i></text>
<text top="237" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="6"><i>Prana </i>is both a super-intelligent cosmic life-energy and the subtle biological conductor in the body, that is, it is both a </text>
<text top="251" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">universal life-force and a physiological actuality. It is both immaterial and material, both independent of here-and-now </text>
<text top="265" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">yet inextricably interwoven with the life of the body. As an energy endowed with intelligence <i>prana </i>compares with our </text>
<text top="279" left="9" width="110" height="13" font="5">similar notion of spirit.</text>
<text top="305" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">Western psychology used the same model of thought from the earliest of Greek ideas until the end of the 18th century. </text>
<text top="319" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">But we no longer use this model of thought in describing psychic energy. In the West energy is either material and </text>
<text top="333" left="9" width="545" height="13" font="5">therefore nervous energy which can be measured and is reducible to electrical or chemical descriptions, or it is an </text>
<text top="347" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">immaterial principle called the soul or mind or libido or <i>'élan vital' </i>which has no physical description. Freud in his early </text>
<text top="361" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">thinking tried to connect the two by deriving libido from sexual liquids; Reich tried to connect psychic energy both to </text>
<text top="375" left="9" width="538" height="13" font="5">sexual physiology and to a cosmic orgone energy in the universe. We are unable to conceive of a unified energy </text>
<text top="388" left="9" width="501" height="13" font="5">principle, since we suffer in the West from the Cartesian division of experience into material and mental.</text>
<text top="414" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">Now, the value of Gopi Krishna's account <i>of prana </i>lies less in the traditional description of it, which one can find as he </text>
<text top="428" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">says in Hindu thought and Yoga texts, than in his own experiences. His actual <i>experience of enlightenment </i>on the first </text>
<text top="442" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">day (the first page of this book) was of the flow into the head of a living liquid light. In other words, what was called in </text>
<text top="456" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">Greek, Arabic, and medieval thought the 'breath', 'the animal spirits' or 'spirits of the soul', and which corresponds in </text>
<text top="470" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">description with <i>prana, </i>and with the circulating light in Chinese yoga and alchemy (see Wilhelm and Jung, <i>The Secret </i></text>
<text top="484" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="6"><i>of the Golden Flower) </i>was spontaneously experienced by our author as such: a living liquid light. It is important to note </text>
<text top="498" left="9" width="541" height="13" font="5">that he was astonished by what happened and that he attempted to fix his attention upon it, as one would observe </text>
<text top="512" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">carefully a spontaneous event occurring in a routine laboratory experiment. He did not make it happen, nor could he </text>
<text top="526" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">make it happen at will. The identification of his consciousness (the watching, attentive ego) with the light yielded a </text>
<text top="540" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">supra-personal experience (outside and above his body) which accords with the theory <i>of prana </i>as a universal energy </text>
<text top="554" left="9" width="98" height="13" font="5">unbounded by body.</text>
<text top="580" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">We may gain a glimpse of how enlightenment can be accounted for psychologically. I do not mean explained, only </text>
<text top="594" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">'given an account of. Evidently, there is an archetypal experience of the circulation or flow of light which has been </text>
<text top="608" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">formulated in many cultures and times into various terms that we now call 'psychic energy'. The flow of this psychic </text>
<text top="622" left="9" width="544" height="13" font="5">energy in its totality is the entire psychological self, or the Self. When the partial system of the ego is released to, </text>
<text top="636" left="9" width="545" height="13" font="5">identifies with, or is overwhelmed by, the self, an experience of enlightenment ensues. This is what Gopi Krishna </text>
<text top="650" left="9" width="546" height="13" font="5">describes. The immersion of the ego in this stream of light is a common theme of religious mysticism, and also of </text>
<text top="663" left="9" width="164" height="13" font="5">psychopatho-logical derangement.</text>
<text top="689" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">Our author was at once confronted with this problem, and the major part of the book deals not with the experiences, but </text>
<text top="703" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">with their <i>integration. </i>The road to the enlightenment experience has been made much shorter with modern hallucinatory</text>
<text top="717" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">drugs and other techniques. The real issue is how to integrate these experiences, how to live with them, how to keep </text>
<text top="731" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">them from overwhelming the body and external reality, how to translate them into awareness and human service, how to</text>
<text top="745" left="9" width="490" height="13" font="5">ground them in the world, in other words, the 'return', how to return with them to the human condition.</text>
<text top="771" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">The first sign of disorder in the flow of light was the turmoil of 'sinister light', 'particles of an ethereal luminous stuff', </text>
<text top="785" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">the 'shower' or 'waterfall spray' effect. Intuitively, Gopi Krishna knew that it was not right. Comparable effects are noted</text>
<text top="799" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">in states of psychological dissociation, in which consciousness appears to break up into multiples of itself, disintegrating</text>
<text top="813" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">into sparks, <i>scintillae, </i>fragments, or hosts of tiny insects. From the Hindu point of view the turmoil could be attributed </text>
</page>
<page number="25" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="842" width="595">
<text top="3" left="9" width="578" height="13" font="5">to a state of mind called <i>'vrtta' </i>('whirling motion'), that is, the self, or light <i>per se, </i>is not disordered, but the state of mind </text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="578" height="13" font="5">of the attachedly observing ego is still affected by hyper-activity. And this we have in the author's statements that he was</text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">searching, questing, questioning, examining, reading, writing letters, worrying, etc. It is the <i>introspective worry </i>itself </text>
<text top="45" left="9" width="438" height="13" font="5">which we might interpret as <i>vrtta </i>and which splits up experience into an anthill of particles.</text>
<text top="71" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">In addition to the fear of madness, the inner derangement of mind, other events occurred which we call in the language </text>
<text top="85" left="9" width="521" height="13" font="5">of <i>psychopathology, </i>'depersonalization', 'disorientation', 'alienation'. The sense of belonging to his own body </text>
<text top="99" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">here-and-now and the feeling connection to his own family were among the first attachments to go. These secondary </text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">symptoms, as well as those of roaring or other sounds and visual distortions which our author describes, belong too to </text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">the symptomatology of various psycho-pathological states called: paranoid, schizophrenic, epileptoid. One might well </text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">imagine that had our author presented himself with this syndrome at a usual Western psychiatric clinic he would have </text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="546" height="13" font="5">been diagnosed in the way that he himself intuitively feared. From the psychiatric view, was this experience not a </text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="91" height="13" font="5">psychotic episode?</text>
<text top="195" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">With this question we come to the heart of a Western problem. We have no other than these diagnostic categories for </text>
<text top="208" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">conceiving states of this kind. Alien and altered states of consciousness are the province of the alienist. Fortunately, </text>
<text top="222" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">Gopi Krishna had another set of concepts (Kundalini yoga) which could place within a non-pathological context what </text>
<text top="236" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">was going on. In so far as the awakening of Kundalini is not limited to the Indian sub-continent only, it is conceivable </text>
<text top="250" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">that some of the experiences described in Western psychiatric interviews could also be viewed as the beginnings of </text>
<text top="264" left="9" width="545" height="13" font="5">enlightenment rather than as the beginnings of insanity. (I think in particular of epilepsy and of Dostoevsky.) The </text>
<text top="278" left="9" width="517" height="13" font="5">touchstone, again, is the same: the way in which the personality handles the experience, the integration of it.</text>
<text top="304" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">It is to our author's credit that he avoided psychiatry, and even medicine, when later he was to go through the feverish </text>
<text top="318" left="9" width="529" height="13" font="5">experience of being burned alive from within. Again, however, from the viewpoint of modern psychiatry such </text>
<text top="332" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">avoidance is typical of a man undergoing paranoid delusions. How close the borderlines are! How much depends upon </text>
<text top="346" left="9" width="534" height="13" font="5">the quality of the person and the way he grapples with the integration of his experience. Sometimes therapeutic </text>
<text top="360" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">psychology lays stress upon its therapeutic task at the expense of the psychological. Then we find that what a person </text>
<text top="374" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">has, his diagnosis, has become more important than who a person is. Psychology is obliged to put the who first, the </text>
<text top="388" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">psyche of the person, his soul with its qualities and virtues, its uniqueness as a moral being for whatever diagnosis it </text>
<text top="402" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">may accrue. Our author was holding to this position. He did not want to be treated, whereas to be 'cured' of what he had </text>
<text top="416" left="9" width="547" height="13" font="5">would have meant loss of both who he was and why he was. As A. Bharati points out in his <i>The Tantric Tradition </i></text>
<text top="430" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">(London, 1965, p. 290), 'if an adept seems to &quot;act mad&quot; it is just because people around him do not see what it is all </text>
<text top="444" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">about, as they are lacking the adept's frame of reference'. Tantric preceptors deny mental disease en route to <i>samadhi </i></text>
<text top="458" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">and warn the adept: 'Do not think the mind is sick when there is <i>samadhi.' </i>Therefore, Gopi Krishna was following the</text>
<text top="472" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">tradition by avoiding professional help, and by staying within the guidelines of tradition he guaranteed his own sanity.</text>
<text top="485" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">Professional counsel, whether medical or spiritual (guru or master) admits the views of another—and superior—into</text>
<text top="499" left="9" width="541" height="13" font="5">one's momentarily abject helplessness. At that moment of seeking help the relationship is not symmetrical: one is</text>
<text top="513" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">professional, the other at a loss. All the health is on one side, sickness on the other. In this condition one too easily hears</text>
<text top="527" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">the collective voice in oneself that does not understand or believe, and so turns the matter and oneself over with suicidal</text>
<text top="541" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">relief to the professional. Gopi Krishna did not split the archetype of the healed one and the wounded one. He stayed</text>
<text top="555" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">right with his ambivalence, believing and doubting, feeling himself found and lost at the same time. This ambivalence</text>
<text top="569" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">was his balance. Had he been more sure, he might have been more deluded; had he been less sure, he might have turned</text>
<text top="583" left="9" width="402" height="13" font="5">himself in for professional treatment and had his doubts confirmed with a diagnosis.</text>
<text top="609" left="9" width="540" height="13" font="5">Next occurs a passage which seems banal enough to skip over, but I believe it deserves a comment. I refer to the </text>
<text top="623" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">information that so reduced was our author in all activities that he took to <i>walking. </i>I have found in my own work with </text>
<text top="637" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">people that during periods of acute psychological pressure, walking was an activity to which they naturally turned; </text>
<text top="651" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">walking not just in idylls of the woods and mountains or by the sea, but simply around the city for hours in the early </text>
<text top="665" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">morning or at night. Prisoners circumambulate the yard, animals exercise in their cages, the anxious pace the floor. One </text>
<text top="679" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">goes for a walk. Man is <i>homo erectus, </i>he is in his element when vertical. More, the agitation of the whirling motion of </text>
<text top="693" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">the mind is placed into an organic rhythm by walking, and this organic rhythm takes on symbolic significance as one </text>
<text top="707" left="9" width="580" height="13" font="5">places one foot after the other, left/right, left/right, in a balanced harmony. Thus the wild spiritual adventure within takes </text>
<text top="721" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">on the deliberate movement of the pilgrimage, even if only around a confined space. So in dreams the symbolism of </text>
<text top="735" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">walking rather than driving or being driven in a vehicle, or even riding a bicycle or an animal, is an 'improvement'. It </text>
<text top="749" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">reflects man's contact with the earth directly, his freedom to wander up and down it, and his continually alternating </text>
<text top="762" left="9" width="158" height="13" font="5">standpoint of left/right, left/right.</text>
<text top="788" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">I see no reason why we cannot accept our author's own view of the <i>heat episode. </i>Can our psychology provide a better </text>
<text top="802" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">explanation of it? It can be compared with some of the wrong turns in alchemy in which there is too much sulphur and </text>
<text top="816" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">the work is burnt black; or where the fire itself (the inner heat, or <i>tapas) </i>is not kept at a low slow temperature but rages </text>

<page number="26" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="842" width="595">
<text top="3" left="9" width="544" height="13" font="5">up too quickly; or in the language of Christian mysticism the fires of Hell, the scorched <i>siccitas. </i>In psychological </text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">practice, comparable experiences are sometimes referred to as unexplained psychosomatic fevers. An interpretation of </text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">the shift from the right-sided pingala to the left-sided ida can be made in this way: habitual consciousness attempts to </text>
<text top="45" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">integrate a new experience in its manner. Despite the shattering of the old vessels (mind, orientation, physical strength, </text>
<text top="59" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">feeling connections, body image), the emotional basis of his masculine consciousness remained intact. This habitual </text>
<text top="73" left="9" width="536" height="13" font="5">canalization of his energies we might call pingala. We may make a comparison to the sulphur in alchemy as the </text>
<text top="87" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">principle of masculine will which must be sublimated by connection to the unconscious (mercury) and joined with its </text>
<text top="101" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">opposite, the feminine principle of salt. The channel through which his will, his control, his ambition, the structure of his</text>
<text top="115" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">energy itself had to be altered. The new wine required a new bottle. The shift from the right to the left side meant an </text>
<text top="129" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">abandonment of his former personality and his identification with what had held him up for the first thirty-five years. No</text>
<text top="143" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">wonder he was laid low; no wonder it was a death experience! The left side of ida is appropriately feminine, just as it is </text>

<text top="269" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">HERE, while begging to be excused for a little digression from the main thread of my narrative, I wish to make it clear </text>
<text top="283" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">that I have no intention of inflicting the variegated story of my life upon the already overtaxed patience of the reader. </text>
<text top="297" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">But I am obliged to embark upon this course, as otherwise the extraordinary development that occurred in me when I </text>
<text top="311" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">was forty-six would not appear in its proper perspective and would lose the immense scientific value which, in my </text>
<text top="325" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">estimation, it possesses and which it is the object of this work to establish. It is with the purpose of aiding scientific </text>
<text top="339" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">inquiry in the much disputed realm of the supernatural that only such of the incidents of my life have been allowed to </text>
<text top="353" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">have a place in this introductory work as had a direct bearing upon the climax and without which scientific investigation</text>
<text top="367" left="9" width="237" height="13" font="5">of that unique culmination would not be possible.</text>
<text top="392" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">I hesitated for nearly twenty years in making the experience public because in the first place, I wanted to make myself </text>
<text top="406" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">completely sure about my own condition, and secondly, I was entirely averse to exposing myself to the criticism of </text>
<text top="420" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">well-meaning friends and the ridicule of opponents. The story I had to relate was so out of the ordinary and so full of </text>
<text top="434" left="9" width="534" height="13" font="5">strange episodes that I was very doubtful about its being accepted as a truthful account of an experience which, </text>
<text top="448" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">extremely rare, has always remained wrapped in mystery from times immemorial. I thought there might be but few who </text>
<text top="462" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">would straight away believe what I had to narrate about the bizarre phenomenon, but the urge to make the hidden truth </text>
<text top="476" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">known prevailed at last. I know that with the publication of this work I am exposing myself to criticism from various </text>
<text top="490" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">quarters, especially from those who should be more interested in the subject. Men of science on the one hand and those </text>
<text top="504" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">of faith on the other, some of whom instead of snatching at the chance of reconciliation offered now are likely to treat it </text>
<text top="518" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">as an encroachment upon the preserves of their idolized opinions and views, forgetting for the moment the fact that truth</text>
<text top="532" left="9" width="326" height="13" font="5">is an entity that grows richer in adversity and stronger in opposition.</text>
<text top="558" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">I know all this, but yielding to an irrepressible urge, which took shape in my mind soon after the appearance of the </text>
<text top="572" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">abnormal condition and which since then has never been wholly absent, demanding wide publicity for the experience as </text>
<text top="586" left="9" width="531" height="13" font="5">the first step towards organized research in all manifestations of the super-conscious for which the time is now </text>
<text top="600" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">opportune, I have applied myself to the task of recapitulating the incidents in my life relevant to the subject with a view </text>
<text top="614" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">to giving coherence to the subsequent surprising development, which though existing in a certain class of men as a </text>
<text top="628" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">natural endowment, has so far eluded every effort directed to its investigation. I have, at the same time, tried to draw </text>
<text top="642" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">attention to the mental and physiological conditions that precede the manifestation of such abnormal developments in </text>
<text top="656" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">man, bearing a resemblance in essentials, though differing in detail, to other phenomena of the kind in the past. But for </text>
<text top="669" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">the fact that the manifestations attending the awakening of Kundalini are at present a sealed book to the world, barring </text>
<text top="683" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">perhaps a few exceptions, there is in actual fact nothing uncommon in my experience, as may be established by other </text>
<text top="697" left="9" width="429" height="13" font="5">similar occurrences in the future for which this work may create the necessary conditions.</text>
<text top="723" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">Excepting the abnormal physiological reactions and the existence and extraordinary behaviour of the luminous vital </text>
<text top="737" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">currents in the body, which to uninitiated and unprepared subjects like me are sure to bring a host of terrors in their </text>
<text top="751" left="9" width="522" height="13" font="5">wake, there is nothing in my experience which even remotely approaches the uncanny and entirely abnormal </text>
<text top="765" left="9" width="540" height="13" font="5">phenomena witnessed by professional mediums and other psychic subjects. What made me hesitate in according </text>
<text top="779" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">publicity to it is the unique nature of the phenomenon; it neither falls in line with the known manifestations observed in </text>
<text top="793" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">mediums, nor does it seem similar in kind to the recorded experience of any known mystic or saint, Eastern or Western. </text>
<text top="807" left="9" width="515" height="13" font="5">Its peculiarity lies in the fact that in its entire character the phenomenon represents the attempt of a hitherto </text>

<text top="71" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">It is an undeniable fact that the quest of the unknown was as unmistakable a feature of ancient civilizations as it is now. </text>
<text top="85" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">There was as persistent a search for the spiritual and the supernatural and as strong a thirst in countless people for the </text>

<text top="141" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">domain were kept the closely guarded secret of a select few. There is not a shadow of doubt that to the ancient adepts of </text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">India, China, or Egypt, the cult of Kundalini was better known than it is to the foremost thinkers of today. On the basis </text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">of my own experience I can assert unhesitatingly that the phenomenon of the effulgent current, its circulation through </text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="548" height="13" font="5">the nerves, the methods of awakening the Power, the regimen to be followed, precautions to be taken, and the part </text>
<text top="197" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">played by the reproductive organs were, as is apparent from the ancient writings or, in the absence of those, from the </text>
<text top="210" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">nature of the ceremonial followed by the initiated, to some extent known to the experts, who, because of the risky nature</text>
<text top="224" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">of the experiment, the hereditary factors involved, and the required mental and physical qualifications, could be but few.</text>
<text top="250" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">It must be said at once to avoid misunderstanding that the cult of Kundalini was not the only path by which the ancients </text>
<text top="264" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">approached the difficult-to-reach domain of the supernatural; there existed contemporaneously other creeds, schools, </text>
<text top="278" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">and systems dealing with the mysterious and the supernatural. As happens even during these days, the followers of the </text>
<text top="292" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">various sects must have tried to tear each other down, belittling the methods of their rivals and extolling their own. The </text>
<text top="306" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">existence of this unceasing warfare, as is obvious, could not but be detrimental to the general acceptance of the system </text>
<text top="320" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">relating to Kundalini, which in consequence was relegated to the background, especially because of the rigid physical </text>
<text top="334" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">regimen, the magnitude of the risk and last but not the least the rarity of a successful consummation, and in the course of</text>
<text top="348" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">time was consigned to the lumber room of obsolete creeds. It can also be said without any fear of contradiction that the </text>
<text top="362" left="9" width="579" height="13" font="5">rise of all great religions of the world, in spite of the fact that each is rooted inextricably in the soil prepared and watered </text>
<text top="376" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">by this prehistoric cult, contributed not a little to eclipse the creed of Kundalini as an honoured and established system </text>
<text top="390" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">of mental and physical discipline for gaining approach to the transcendental. It, however, continues to exist in India in </text>
<text top="404" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">form only, divested of its former importance and influence, though still retaining much of the fascination that it once </text>
<text top="418" left="9" width="220" height="13" font="5">exerted on seekers trying to reach the Unseen.</text>
<text top="444" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">It is obvious that all religions, all creeds, and all sects, including even the bloody cults of savages and the self-torturing </text>
<text top="458" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">or self-mutilating creeds found up to recent times, owe their origin to the existence of an urge, rooted deep in human </text>
<text top="472" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">nature, which finds expression in countless ways, healthy and unhealthy, and has been the constant companion of man </text>
<text top="485" left="9" width="544" height="13" font="5">all through his ascent from the most primitive condition to the present state. The desire for resolving the riddle of </text>
<text top="499" left="9" width="527" height="13" font="5">existence, for supersensual experience, for establishing contact with the hidden forces of nature or for gaining </text>
<text top="513" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">supernormal powers, present in many minds with overpowering and compelling effect, is but a mode of expression of </text>
<text top="527" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">this yet incompletely understood but potent impulse, which, rising from the depths of being, emerges as a part and </text>
<text top="541" left="9" width="405" height="13" font="5">parcel of one's personality, often discernible in thought and action from an early age.</text>

<text top="581" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">one way or another aim to provide a channel of communication with the supersensible, the divine or the occult, or offer </text>
<text top="595" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">an avenue for exploring the mystery of being, are all means, both effective and defective, to procure satisfaction for this </text>
<text top="609" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">deeply seated and universally present urge. The form taken may be of a heinous bloody sacrifice, a gaping self-inflicted </text>
<text top="623" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">wound, the self-caused blindness of the sun-gazer or constant torture to the body on a bed of nails, melodious chanting </text>
<text top="637" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">of hymns, recitation of prayers, prostration in devout worship, the discipline of Yoga, or any other spiritual exercise; the</text>
<text top="651" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">objective invariably is the occult, the mysterious, or the supersensible in divine, demoniac, spiritual or any other form.</text>
<text top="677" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">From the very beginning the urge has expressed itself in an infinite variety of religious beliefs and creeds, superstitions </text>
<text top="691" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">and taboos traceable to the remotest epochs of man's existence. The impulse to invest the inanimate forces of nature with</text>
<text top="705" left="9" width="534" height="13" font="5">intelligence and to credit the spirits of the dead with continued existence beyond the grave, characteristic of the </text>
<text top="719" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">primitive mind and the civilized man's attempt to postulate an almighty Creator and to offer worship to Him, arose from </text>
<text top="733" left="9" width="541" height="13" font="5">the same source and owe their existence to the presence in the human organism of an extremely complicated and </text>
<text top="747" left="9" width="387" height="13" font="5">difficult to locate mechanism, which the ancient Indian <i>savants </i>called Kundalini.</text>

<text top="679" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">nature to that which resides in the normal human body. It is for this reason that the mode of conduct or intellectual </text>

<text top="87" left="9" width="545" height="13" font="5">evidence before, that I decided to put the extraordinary episode on paper. This resolve was further fortified by the </text>
<text top="101" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">consideration that Kundalini is active in millions of intelligent men of all civilized nations, though in a lesser degree and</text>
<text top="115" left="9" width="535" height="13" font="5">imperceptibly, creating in the majority psychic and physical disturbances which modern therapy is incapable of </text>
<text top="129" left="9" width="324" height="13" font="5">preventing or curing because of absolute ignorance about the cause.</text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">Considering the colossal nature of the physical and mental metamorphosis that has to be effected as a prelude to spiritual</text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">un-foldment, I do not wonder at the accompanying trials and tribulations, since the mystic state represents the last and </text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">most arduous lap of the journey which began with man's ascent from dust; it terminates with his tasting, after suffering </text>
<text top="197" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">and travail, the incomparable bliss of unembodied existence, not after death, but within his span of life on earth. The </text>
<text top="210" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">path in front of him now is so difficult and of such bewildering alignment that it will need all his will-power and all the </text>
<text top="224" left="9" width="452" height="13" font="5">resources of his intellect to negotiate it safely step by step until the goal comes clearly in sight.</text>
<text top="250" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">When I awoke the following morning, I found myself too weak to rise from bed without assistance, and I remained lying</text>
<text top="264" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">down, revolving in my mind the fearful incidents of the night, while profuse tears of thankfulness streamed down my </text>
<text top="278" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">face at what I thought was divine intervention at a most critical time to save me from a dreadful fate. The more I thought</text>
<text top="292" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">about it, the more convinced I became that a superhuman agency acting through my mind had conveyed the hint, which </text>
<text top="306" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">in that terribly agitated state I could never have thought of myself, by which I was able to extricate myself from an </text>
<text top="320" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">entirely hopeless situation absolutely beyond the reach of mortal aid. No power on earth could have saved me from </text>
<text top="334" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">death or insanity, nor could any medicine have alleviated my suffering. As if planted in my mind from the very start to </text>
<text top="348" left="9" width="546" height="13" font="5">save me from submitting my body for experimentation by healers not competent to deal with my condition and to </text>
<text top="362" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">protect me from the deleterious effects of common drugs that would have acted as veritable poisons in that extremely </text>
<text top="376" left="9" width="543" height="13" font="5">sensitive and delicate state of my nerves, I felt from the first day of my affliction a deeply rooted aversion to take </text>
<text top="390" left="9" width="545" height="13" font="5">medical men into my confidence about this extraordinary ailment; not that I had no respect for the profession, but </text>
<text top="404" left="9" width="504" height="13" font="5">because I had a feeling that my malady was beyond the grasp and power of the highest medical authority.</text>
<text top="430" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">With a feeling of relief I at last rose weakly from bed like a man in whom an invisible but intense internal fire has burnt </text>
<text top="444" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">for hours and who finds that not only has the fire been extinguished but even the excruciating pain of the burns has </text>
<text top="458" left="9" width="536" height="13" font="5">disappeared miraculously overnight. I looked at myself in a mirror and found my face pale and haggard, but the </text>
<text top="472" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">maniacal expression had nearly vanished and the gleam of madness was almost gone from my eyes. I was looking at a </text>
<text top="485" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">sane but terribly weak and anguished countenance that had borne, as it were, the torture of hell for days and days. My </text>
<text top="499" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">tongue was still coated and my pulse weak and irregular, but all other signs and symptoms regarding the condition of </text>
<text top="513" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">my organs were so reassuring that my heart leapt with joy and hope. There was no diminution in the vital radiation </text>
<text top="527" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">which, emanating from the seat of Kundalini, sped across my nerves to every part of the body, filling my ears with </text>
<text top="541" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">strange sounds and my head with strange lights; but the current was now warm and pleasing instead of hot and burning, </text>
<text top="555" left="9" width="417" height="13" font="5">and it soothed and refreshed the tortured cells and tissues in a truly miraculous manner.</text>
<text top="581" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">During the next day and the days following, I paid scrupulous attention to my diet, taking only a few slices of bread or a</text>
<text top="595" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">little boiled rice with a cup of milk every three hours from morning until about ten o'clock at night. The amount of food </text>
<text top="609" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">taken each time was extremely small, a few morsels and no more. After the last meal, when I laid myself down to sleep, </text>
<text top="623" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">I found to my great joy a gentle drowsiness stealing upon me in spite of the shining halo surrounding my head, and I fell</text>
<text top="637" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">asleep enveloped in a radiating and soothing mantle of light. I awoke next morning greatly refreshed in mind, but still </text>
<text top="651" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">extremely weak in body. I had no strength to walk and reeled when I stood up. But my head was clear and the fear that </text>
<text top="665" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">had pursued me had decreased considerably. I was able, for the first time after weeks of anguish, to collect my thoughts </text>
<text top="679" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">and to think clearly. It took me about a week to gain sufficient strength to walk from one room to another and to remain </text>
<text top="693" left="9" width="548" height="13" font="5">standing for any length of time. I do not know what reserve store of energy sustained me during the terrible ordeal </text>
<text top="707" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">before the last miraculous episode, as I had had practically no food for more than two months. I did not feel as weak </text>
<text top="721" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">then as I now felt, probably because in the poisoned state of my nerves I was wholly incapable of assessing correctly the</text>
<text top="735" left="9" width="106" height="13" font="5">condition of my body.</text>
<text top="760" left="9" width="542" height="13" font="5">Days and weeks passed, adding to my strength and to the assurance that I was in no imminent mental or physical </text>
<text top="774" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">danger. But my condition was abnormal, and the more I studied it with growing clarity of mind, the more I wondered </text>
<text top="788" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">and the more uncertain I became about the outcome. I was in an extraordinary state: a lustrous medium intensely alive </text>
<text top="802" left="9" width="537" height="13" font="5">and acutely sentient, shining day and night, permeated my whole system, racing through every part of my body, </text>
<text top="816" left="9" width="544" height="13" font="5">perfectly at home and absolutely sure of its path. I often watched the marvellous play of this radiant force in utter </text>
</page>
<page number="30" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="842" width="595">
<text top="3" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">bewilderment. I had no doubt that Kundalini was now fully awake in me, but there was absolutely no sign of miraculous</text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">psychic and mental powers associated with it by the ancients. I could not detect any change in me for the better; on the </text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">contrary, my physical condition had considerably deteriorated and my head was yet far from steady. I could not read </text>
<text top="45" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">attentively or devote myself with undivided mind to any task. Any sustained effort at concentration invariably resulted </text>
<text top="59" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">in an intensification of the abnormal condition. The halo in my head increased enormously in size after every spell of </text>
<text top="73" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">prolonged attention, creating a further heightening of my consciousness with a corresponding increase in the sense of </text>
<text top="87" left="9" width="334" height="13" font="5">fear now present only occasionally, and that, too, in a very mild form.</text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">Perceiving no sign of spiritual florescence and always confronted by the erratic behaviour of an altered mind, I could not</text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">but be assailed by grave misgivings about myself after watching my condition for a few weeks. Was this all that one </text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">could achieve after rousing the serpent fire? I asked myself this question over and over again. Was this all, for which </text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">countless men had risked their lives, discarded their homes and families, braved the terrors of trackless forests, suffered </text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">hunger and privations, and sat at the feet of teachers for years to know? Was this all that yogis, saints, and mystics </text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">experienced in ecstatic trances, this extension of consciousness accompanied by unearthly lights and sounds, carrying a </text>
<text top="197" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">man momentarily into an abnormal mental state and then dashing him again to earth, without creating any extraordinary </text>
<text top="210" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">talent or quality to distinguish him from the average run of mortals? Was this ebb and flow of a subtle radiant essence </text>
<text top="224" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">and the resultant widening and narrowing of consciousness which I witnessed day and night the ultimate goal to which </text>
<text top="238" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">the occult doctrines of the world pointed with confidence? If this were all one could achieve, then surely it was far better</text>
<text top="252" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">not to delve into the supernatural, but to devote oneself with undivided attention to worldly pursuits and to follow the </text>
<text top="266" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">common path, to pass an undisturbed, happy existence free from the uncertainty and fear which had now become an </text>
<text top="280" left="9" width="129" height="13" font="5">inseparable part of my life.</text>
<text top="306" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">I continued to pay careful attention to my diet, as experience had now made me fully alive to the fact that my life and </text>
<text top="320" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">sanity depended on it. I did not eat in excess of the quantity I deemed proper for myself, fixing the amount according to </text>
<text top="334" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">the reaction of my digestive parts, nor did I allow any delicacy to tempt me to depart from my self-imposed regimen. </text>
<text top="348" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">There was reason enough to make me extremely cautious on this score, as the slightest indiscretion in respect to the </text>
<text top="362" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">quantity or quality of the food consumed and any disregard of time created results and reactions so disagreeable and </text>
<text top="376" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">distressing as to make me upbraid myself severely for having committed the mistake. This happened time after time as if</text>
<text top="390" left="9" width="545" height="13" font="5">to impress indelibly upon my mind the fact that from now onwards I had not to eat for pleasure or the mechanical </text>
<text top="404" left="9" width="543" height="13" font="5">satisfaction of hunger, but to regulate the intake of food with such precision as not to cause the least strain on my </text>
<text top="418" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">oversensitive and over-stimulated nervous system. There was no escape from this forced regimentation, and during the </text>
<text top="432" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">first few weeks, even the slightest error was instantaneously punished with an intensification of fear and a warning </text>
<text top="446" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">disturbance at the heart and digestive centres. Usually, on such occasions my mind lost its flexibility and I felt powerless</text>
<text top="460" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">to shake myself free of the gloom that unaccountably settled upon me all of a sudden after eating the offending morsel. </text>
<text top="474" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">In my anxiety to avoid those unpleasant visitations, I was meticulous not to commit the least error; but try as I might, </text>
<text top="487" left="9" width="464" height="13" font="5">mistakes did occur now and then, almost always followed by suffering and penitence on my part.</text>
<text top="513" left="9" width="548" height="13" font="5">For the proper understanding of my condition after the memorable night of my release, it is necessary to say a few </text>
<text top="527" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">words about my mental state as well as about the radiating vital current, darting up and down my spine, which was now </text>
<text top="541" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">a part of my being. My mind did not function as before. There had occurred a definite and unmistakable change. At that </text>
<text top="555" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">time my thought images came and went against a sombre background possessing vaguely the same combination of light,</text>
<text top="569" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">shade, and colour as characterized the original objects which they represented; but now the images were vivid and bright</text>
<text top="583" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">as if carved out of living flame, and they floated against a luminous background as if the process of thought was now </text>
<text top="597" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">done with another kind of lustrous mental stuff, not only bright itself but also capable of perceiving its own brilliance. </text>
<text top="611" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">Whenever I turned my mental eye upon myself I invariably perceived a luminous glow within and outside my head in a </text>
<text top="625" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">state of constant vibration, as if a jet of an extremely subtle and brilliant substance rising through the spine spread itself </text>
<text top="639" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">out in the cranium, filling and surrounding it with an indescribable radiance. This shining halo never remained constant </text>
<text top="653" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">in dimension or in the intensity of its brightness. It waxed and waned, brightened and grew dim, or changed its colour </text>
<text top="667" left="9" width="545" height="13" font="5">from silver to gold and vice versa. When it increased in size or brilliance, the strange noise in my ears, now never </text>
<text top="681" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">absent, grew louder and more insistent, as if drawing my attention to something I could not understand. The halo was </text>
<text top="695" left="9" width="540" height="13" font="5">never stationary but in a state of perpetual motion, dancing and leaping, eddying and swirling, as if composed of </text>
<text top="709" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">innumerable, extremely subtle, brilliant particles of some immaterial substance, shooting up and down, this way and </text>
<text top="723" left="9" width="384" height="13" font="5">that, combining to present an appearance of a circling, shimmering pool of light.</text>
<text top="749" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">The constant presence of the luminous glow in my head and its close association with my thought processes was not a </text>
<text top="762" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">matter for such bewilderment as its ceaseless interference with the normal working of my vital organs. I could distinctly </text>
<text top="776" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">feel and perceive its passage across the spine and other nerves into the heart or liver or stomach or other organs in the </text>
<text top="790" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">body, whose activity it seemed to regulate in a mysterious manner. When it penetrated the heart, my pulse became fuller</text>
<text top="804" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">and stronger, showing unmistakably that some kind of tonic radiation was being poured into it through the connecting </text>
<text top="818" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">nerves. From this I concluded that its penetration into the other organs had the same vivifying and invigorating effect </text>
</page>
<page number="31" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="842" width="595">
<text top="3" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">and that its purpose in darting through the nerves to reach them was to pour its tonic substance into their tissues and </text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="545" height="13" font="5">cells through the slender nerve filaments, stimulating or modifying their action. The penetration was occasionally </text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">followed by pain, either in the organ itself or at the point where the linking nerve entered it, or at the point of contact </text>
<text top="45" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">with the spinal cord, or both, and was often accompanied by feelings of fear. It appeared on such occasions that the </text>
<text top="59" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">stream of radiant energy rising into the brain was sending offshoots into the other vital organs to regulate and improve </text>
<text top="73" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">their functions in harmony with the new development in my head. I searched my brain for an explanation and revolved </text>
<text top="87" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">every possibility in my mind to account for the surprising development as I watched attentively the incredible movement</text>
<text top="101" left="9" width="544" height="13" font="5">of this intelligent radiation from hour to hour and day to day. At times I was amazed at the uncanny knowledge it </text>
<text top="115" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">displayed of the complicated nervous mechanism and the masterly way in which it darted here and there as if aware of </text>
<text top="129" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">every twist and turn in the body. Most probably it was because of its almost unlimited dominance over the whole vital </text>
<text top="143" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">mechanism that the ancient writers named Kundalini as the queen of the nervous system, controlling all the thousands of</text>
<text top="157" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">'nadis' or nerves in the body, and for the same reason have designated her as 'Adhar Shakti'*, on which depends the </text>
<text top="171" left="9" width="358" height="13" font="5">existence of the body and the universe, the microcosm and the macrocosm.</text>
<text top="197" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">But I could detect no change in my mental capacity; I thought the same thoughts and both inside and out was the same </text>
<text top="210" left="9" width="546" height="13" font="5">mediocre type of man like millions of others who are born and die every year without creating the least stir on the </text>
<text top="224" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">surface of the ever-flowing stream of humanity. There was no doubt an extraordinary change in my nervous equipment, </text>
<text top="238" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">and a new type of force was now racing through my system connected unmistakably with the sexual parts, which also </text>
<text top="252" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">seemed to have developed a new kind of activity not perceptible before. The nerves lining the parts and the surrounding </text>
<text top="266" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">region were all in a state of intense ferment, as if forced by an invisible mechanism to produce the vital seed in abnormal</text>
<text top="280" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">abundance to be sucked up by the network of nerves at the base of the spine for transmission into the brain through the </text>
<text top="294" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">spinal cord. The sublimated seed formed an integral part of the radiant energy which was causing me such bewilderment</text>
<text top="308" left="9" width="325" height="13" font="5">and about which I was as yet unable to speculate with any degree of</text>
<text top="335" left="9" width="62" height="12" font="8">* Basic shakti.</text>
<text top="360" left="9" width="548" height="13" font="5">assurance. I could readily perceive the transmutation of the vital seed into radiation and the unusual activity of the </text>
<text top="374" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">reproductive organs for supplying the raw material for transformation in the mysterious laboratory at the lowest plexus, </text>
<text top="388" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">or <i>muladhara chakra, </i>as the yogis name it, into that extremely subtle and ordinarily imperceptible stuff we call nervous </text>
<text top="402" left="9" width="533" height="13" font="5">energy, on which the entire mechanism of the body depends, with the difference that the energy now generated </text>
<text top="416" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">possessed luminosity and was of a quality allowing detection of its rapid passage through the nerves and tissues, not </text>
<text top="430" left="9" width="359" height="13" font="5">only by its radiance but also by the sensations it caused with its movement.</text>
<text top="456" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">For a long time I could not understand what hidden purpose was being served by the unremitting flow of the new-born </text>
<text top="469" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">nervous radiation and what changes were being wrought in the organs and nerves and in the structure of the brain by this</text>
<text top="483" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">unceasing shower of the powerful vital essence drawn from the most precious and most potent secretion in the body. </text>
<text top="497" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">Immediately after the crisis, however, I noticed a marked change in my digestive and eliminatory functions, a change so </text>
<text top="511" left="9" width="548" height="13" font="5">remarkable that it could not be assigned to accident or to any other factor save the serpent fire and its effect on the </text>
<text top="525" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">organism. It appeared as if I were undergoing a process of purgation, of internal purification of the organs and nerves, </text>
<text top="539" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">and that my digestive apparatus was being toned to a higher pitch of efficiency to ensure a cleaner and healthier state of </text>
<text top="553" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">the nerves and other tissues. I encountered no constipation or indigestion, provided I refrained from overloading the </text>
<text top="567" left="9" width="546" height="13" font="5">stomach and followed strictly the regimen of eating which experience was forcing on me. My most important and </text>
<text top="581" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">essential duty now was to feed the sacred flame with healthy food, at proper intervals, with due regard to the fact that </text>
<text top="595" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">the diet was nourishing, containing all the ingredients and vitamins needed for the maintenance of a robust and healthy </text>
<text top="609" left="9" width="27" height="13" font="5">body.</text>
<text top="635" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">I was now a spectator of a weird drama enacted in my own body in which an immensely active and powerful vital force,</text>

<text top="17" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">functioned in complete harmony with the bodily organs, knowing their strength and weakness, obeying its own laws and</text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">acting with a superior intelligence beyond my comprehension. The living fire, invisible to everyone else, darted here and</text>
<text top="45" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">there as if guided unerringly by a master-mind which knew the position of each vein and artery and each nerve fibre, </text>
<text top="59" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">and decided instantaneously what it had to do at the least sign of a hitch or disturbance in any organ. With marvellous </text>
<text top="73" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">agility it raced from one spot to another, exciting this organ to greater activity, slowing down another, causing a greater </text>

<text top="101" left="9" width="524" height="13" font="5">changes in the innumerable cells, blood vessels, nerve fibres, and other tissues. I watched the phenomenon in </text>
<text top="115" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">amazement. With the aid of the luminous stuff now filling my nerves, I could, by diverting my attention towards my </text>
<text top="129" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">interior, discern clearly the outlines of the vital organs and the network of nerves spread all over my body, as if the </text>
<text top="143" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">centre of consciousness in the brain, now always ablaze with light, had acquired a more penetrating inner sight by which</text>
<text top="157" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">it could look inside and perceive dimly the interior of the body as it could see its exterior in a hazy, uncertain light. At </text>
<text top="171" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">times, turning my attention upon myself, I distinctly saw my body as a column of living fire from the tips of my toes to </text>
<text top="185" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">the head in which innumerable currents circled and eddied, causing at places whirlpools and vortices, all forming part of</text>
<text top="199" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">a vast heaving sea of light, perpetually in motion. It was not a hallucination, as the experience was repeated innumerable</text>
<text top="212" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">times. The only explanation to account for it that occurred to me was that on such occasions my undeniably extended </text>
<text top="226" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">consciousness was in contact with the world of 'prana', or cosmic vital energy, which is not normally perceptible to the </text>
<text top="240" left="9" width="522" height="13" font="5">common man, but is the first subtle, immaterial substance to come within the range of superconscious vision.</text>

<text top="294" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">completely bewildered and unnerved by this sudden plunge into the occult. From the very first day I felt myself walking</text>
<text top="308" left="9" width="512" height="13" font="5">on a ground that was not only unfamiliar but presented such queer formations that, losing my bearings and </text>
<text top="322" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">self-confidence, I trod hesitatingly with utmost caution, fearing a pitfall at every step. I looked around desperately for </text>
<text top="336" left="9" width="242" height="13" font="5">guidance, only to face disappointment on all sides.</text>
<text top="362" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">Without mentioning my condition, I talked to several scholars and Sadhus well versed in Tantric lore, with the object of </text>
<text top="376" left="9" width="544" height="13" font="5">gleaning some useful hints for myself, but found to my sorrow that beyond a parrot-like repetition of information </text>
<text top="390" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">gathered from books, they could not give me any advice or authoritative guidance based on experience. On the other </text>

<text top="485" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">approach. There were the dignified heads of various orders with hundreds of devoted followers. There were the princely </text>
<text top="499" left="9" width="580" height="13" font="5">divines residing in cities, counting titled aristocrats, rajahs, and magnates among their disciples, and there were the silent </text>

<text top="527" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">homage to them. Then there were the ordinary Sadhus gathered in colonies or living alone or roaming about from place </text>
<text top="541" left="9" width="517" height="13" font="5">to place, diversely garbed or almost unclad, belonging to various sects with striking peculiarities and quaint </text>
<text top="555" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">accoutrements and carrying with them an atmosphere of weird-ness and mystery wherever they went. I had seen and </text>
<text top="569" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">talked to many of them from my boyhood, the most accomplished as well as the least sophisticated, and the impressions </text>

<text top="597" left="9" width="536" height="13" font="5">about my condition. At least I did not know of any, and therefore the only alternative open to me was to make a </text>
<text top="611" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">widespread search for one. But I had neither the means nor the physical capacity to travel from place to place looking </text>

<text top="679" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">At last mustering my courage, I wrote to one of the best-known modern saints of India the author of many widely read </text>
<text top="693" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">books in English on Yoga, giving him full details of my extraordinary state and sought for guidance. I waited for his </text>
<text top="707" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">reply in trepidation, and when it failed to come for some days, I sent a telegram also. I was passing a very anxious time </text>

<text top="43" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">symptoms for a while and then gave me the address of an Ashram in East Bengal, the head of which was supposed to be</text>
<text top="57" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">a Yogi of the highest order, who had himself practised Kundalini yoga. I wrote to the address given, receiving a reply </text>
<text top="71" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">that I had undoubtedly aroused the Shakti but the man who could guide me had left on a pilgrimage. I consulted other </text>

<text top="127" left="9" width="528" height="13" font="5">in accurate information about the mysterious power rampant in me as those of a more unassuming nature who </text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">unbosomed themselves completely on the very first occasion without in the least pretending to know any more than they</text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">really did. And thus in the great country which had given birth to the lofty science of Kundalini thousands of years ago </text>

<text top="236" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">the spinal cord and round the lower orifice. There undeniably was the abode of Kundalini, as described by Yogis, the </text>

<text top="500" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">We meet in Chapter Five the <i>ideational context </i>of our author's experience. This cannot be overestimated. Our author did</text>
<text top="514" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">well to place it at this point, because it is the supporting frame which kept his experience from going wrong. He had </text>
<text top="528" left="9" width="546" height="13" font="5">developed subjective anchors during the first part of his life. He had practised yoga, but the practise itself was not </text>
<text top="542" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">enough. For a Westerner even more the practise of yoga is not enough. Yoga is based on a philosophical system of </text>
<text top="556" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">ideas, a <i>Weltanschauung, </i>a way of viewing self and world, and this must be operative in a critical time as that context of</text>
<text top="570" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">meaning on to which one can fall. This context of meaning made it possible for Gopi Krishna to comprehend and thus to</text>
<text top="584" left="9" width="247" height="13" font="5">further and to integrate what was happening to him.</text>
<text top="610" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">Again, to our loss in the West, we are so lacking in an adequate context that we do indeed go to pieces at the eruption of </text>
<text top="624" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">the unconscious, thereby justifying the psychiatric view. Fortunately, Jung's analytical psychology gives in its account </text>
<text top="638" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">of the process of individuation a context within which these events can be meaningfully comprehended. Fortunately, </text>
<text top="652" left="9" width="523" height="13" font="5">too, Jung studied as a psychologist this branch of yoga. He called the Kundalini an example of the instinct of </text>
<text top="665" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">individuation. Therefore, comparisons between its manifestations and other examples of the individuation process (e.g. </text>
<text top="679" left="9" width="529" height="13" font="5">alchemy) provide a psychologically objective knowledge without which there would be no way of taking hold </text>
<text top="693" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">(comprehending, <i>begreifen) </i>what is going on. Very often, therefore, it is of utmost value during a period of critical </text>
<text top="707" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">psychological pressure in which the unconscious boils over, to provide the sufferer with psychological knowledge. His </text>
<text top="721" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">experience needs to be confirmed with objective material much as the yoga disciplines provide, showing that what he is </text>
<text top="735" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">going through is appropriate and belongs to the process. The analyst is called on to confirm the other's experiences </text>
<text top="749" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">through his own, and what he has gained from working with others; as well, he has at his disposal knowledge of the </text>
<text top="763" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">process in general as described in mysticism, rituals of primitives, mythologies, spiritual disciplines, and works such as </text>
<text top="777" left="9" width="103" height="13" font="5">this by Gopi Krishna.</text>
<text top="803" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">Our author stresses the <i>evolutionary importance of the events, </i>and indeed calls his book 'The Evolutionary Energy in </text>
<text top="817" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">Man'. I do not wish to contend this point. It is a favourite idea of many, including Teilhard de Chardin. This much, </text>

<page number="34" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="842" width="595">
<text top="3" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">however, can be said: there is evidently an archetypal connection between profound mystical experiences of this sort in </text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="537" height="13" font="5">which one's own consciousness has evolved and personality developed, and the idea that the same experience is </text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="323" height="13" font="5">fundamentally possible for all men and therefore meant for all men.</text>
<text top="57" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">Religious experience of this sort brings with it the gift or curse of messianism and prophecy. Psychologically, it was </text>
<text top="71" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">evidently valuable for our author to feel that what he was going through was not only personally meaningful but that it </text>
<text top="85" left="9" width="378" height="13" font="5">had as well a universal meaning. Experiences of the Self have this universality.</text>
<text top="111" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">We often then speak of inflation when the ego does not integrate the cosmic idea but takes it at face value. And perhaps </text>
<text top="125" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">it is meant to be taken at face value. How is one to know? Enough for our purpose to recognize the appearance of a </text>
<text top="139" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">sense of transcendent purposefulness as the events unfolded, and that this transcendent purposefulness was interpreted </text>
<text top="153" left="9" width="229" height="13" font="5">by our author in the traditional manner as a call.</text>
<text top="179" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">There are many references to <i>diet </i>in the text. Of course, they can be said to represent the obsessive concern of the highly</text>
<text top="193" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">intuitive person with the sensation details of life, especially life of the body. I recall a paranoid man in hospital, the</text>
<text top="206" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">subject of whose conversations with me was on the one hand abstract mathematical theories and visionary poetry and on</text>
<text top="220" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">the other the system of his food intake—how many slices of bread to eat at lunch, the nutritive value of tomatoes, etc.</text>
<text top="234" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">But diet cult cannot be reduced to compensation alone. The popular press gives accounts to fascinated readers exactly</text>
<text top="248" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">how, what, and when the great men eat. The great are often obsessed with diet. Food after all quite simply means world,</text>
<text top="262" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">and one's eating habits represent one's habitual way of taking in the world. Gopi Krishna clearly had to stop feeding</text>
<text top="276" left="9" width="537" height="13" font="5">himself in his former way. This shift of attitude towards food reflects a shift from the outer to the inner aspect of</text>
<text top="290" left="9" width="439" height="13" font="5">life-in-the-world, called in Hindu terminology a shift from the <i>sthula </i>to the <i>sukshma </i>aspect.</text>
<text top="316" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">He writes: 'This happened time after time as if to impress indelibly upon my mind the fact that from now onwards I had </text>
<text top="330" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">not to eat for pleasure or the mechanical satisfaction of hunger, but to regulate the intake of food with such precision so </text>
<text top="344" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">as not to cause the least strain on my over-sensitive... nervous system.' In other words, genetically a most fundamental </text>
<text top="358" left="9" width="520" height="13" font="5">instinct, a primary level of psychological life (the oral stage) was also now in service of the ongoing process.</text>
<text top="384" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">He approaches his diet with 'precision'. The mention of that word in this context indicates to me the differences between </text>
<text top="398" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">a wrong and right kind of compulsiveness. Precision about psychic life, whether in exercises and diet of the body, in </text>
<text top="412" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">details of dreams and fantasies, in the elaboration of imagination into art, points to the way in which the drivenness of </text>
<text top="426" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">obsessive compulsion can be overcome from within by its own principle. Like cures like. The psyche has an affinity for </text>
<text top="440" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">precision; witness the details in children's stories, primitive rituals and primitive languages, and the exactitude with </text>
<text top="454" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">which we go about anything that is important. Precision is not a preserve of natural science nor is the precise method to </text>
<text top="468" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">be identified with measurements only. Our author realizes that to change his style he must be precise about every detail. </text>

<text top="605" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">would be if we could understand these body changes in the way in which Gopi Krishna did, as necessary preparations </text>
<text top="619" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">for enlarged consciousness. If the body is the carrier of consciousness, it too must be altered. Yet, though Gopi Krishna </text>
<text top="633" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">understood this, each alteration he sensed brought <i>fear. </i>It seems as if there is a deep animal fear, a kind of biological </text>

<text top="45" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">practices, as well as in yoga. It is also fundamental to Taoist sexual theories, (see R. van Gulik, <i>Sexual Life in Ancient </i></text>

<text top="129" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">spine or via the blood. Loss of seed means loss of that vital essence which is the source of the living liquid light. Semen </text>
<text top="143" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">must therefore be discerned and discharged upwards rather than outwards, thereby adding to the internal circulation of </text>
<text top="157" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="6"><i>prana. </i>Bharati <i>(op. cit.) </i>speaks of the difference between Buddhist and Hindu attitudes. The former, as the Taoists, </text>
<text top="171" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">retain the semen; the latter discharge it (left-hand path of Tantrism) as sacrifice. In each of these varied traditions one </text>
<text top="185" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">idea stands out: the transformation of consciousness requires the transformation of sexuality which takes place through </text>

<text top="224" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">Our text refers to unusual ferment in the genital parts and to the production of an increased abundance of semen. This </text>
<text top="238" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">runs contrary to the usual notions that yoga is an ascetic discipline through which the sexual impulse is depotentiated. </text>
<text top="252" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">Just not! And we can understand why chastity and continence and other sexual mysti-tiques (including the orgy and </text>
<text top="266" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">black mass) belong archetypally to the discipline of the 'holy man'. It is not that he has less sexuality than others, but </text>
<text top="280" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">more. (For example, an early sign of the call to shamanism among the American Mohave Indians is frequent childhood </text>
<text top="294" left="9" width="535" height="13" font="5">masturbation.) The 'holy man' as 'greater personality' implies the endowment of greater sexuality; therefore, the </text>
<text top="308" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">transformation of it raises all sorts of problems, answers to which have been formulated in various esoteric techniques </text>
<text top="322" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">and disciplines, West and East, of which chastity and <i>the ritual copulation of Tantric maithuna </i>would be opposite poles </text>
<text top="336" left="9" width="170" height="13" font="5">of the same archetypal formulation.</text>
<text top="362" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">It is not infrequent in analytical practice that phases of obsessive sexuality (sexual dreams, fixations on the genitals, </text>
<text top="376" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">sado-masochism, masturbation, nocturnal emissions) occupy the centre of the stage for a time. Reduction of these events</text>
<text top="390" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">to oedipal conflicts is not alone sufficient. If a process of transformation is truly going on, then it will affect a person's </text>
<text top="404" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">sexual life, drawing his attention to his sexuality, and sexuality as such (which then takes on the numinous power of a </text>
<text top="418" left="9" width="513" height="13" font="5">God, formulated long ago in other cultures as the Lingam, or as Priapus). The ground of possibility for any </text>
<text top="432" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">transformation of sexuality is the recognition of it as an impersonal power. The <i>maithuna </i>aspect of tantric yoga makes </text>
<text top="446" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">this clear. It is not <i>my </i>sex and <i>my </i>pleasure and <i>my </i>orgasm; it is a force that flows through me, a force of play, joy, and</text>
<text top="460" left="9" width="504" height="13" font="5">creation. By separating the personal out of it, one can listen to it, obey or deny it, note its fluctuations and</text>
<text top="474" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">intentions—all of which means relating to it objectively. Once this step has been taken, the transformation at which our</text>

<text top="515" left="9" width="221" height="13" font="5">religiously sacrificial and erotically educative.</text>
<text top="541" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">In several places, we note our author's difficulty with <i>reading.</i> Not only could he not find the right material to study; he </text>
<text top="555" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">also could not concentrate. One of the first things that had to go was intellectual concentration. We call this in analytical </text>
<text top="569" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">work the <i>'sacrificium intellectus'. </i>It refers to the state when one is forced to abandon oneself to the on-going process, as </text>
<text top="583" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">to a river, without knowing where it will lead, without having a chart of the course, without knowledge aforehand. The </text>
<text top="597" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">intellect can easily take over experiences and deprive them of their livingness. So in Freudian analysis the patient is </text>
<text top="611" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">generally not supposed to read psychology. In Jungian analysis there is no such rule, for when and what to read depends </text>
<text top="625" left="9" width="537" height="13" font="5">entirely on the actual situation. And it was a long time before the ability to read again returned to Gopi Krishna, </text>
<text top="639" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">indicating how strong the hold of the intellect can be, and in his case, what a danger it was. We must remember that he </text>
<text top="653" left="9" width="523" height="13" font="5">originally set out for an intellectual life from which he was saved by the examination failure. This points to a </text>
<text top="667" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">psychological truth: the greatest danger to our true calling, whatever it may be, is the one closest to it, the one which is </text>
<text top="681" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">the shadow of the substance. One is less likely to mistake green or white for true red, than rose, pink, or burgundy. Each</text>
<text top="695" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">contact with reading and intellectual formulation led him astray by endangering the process as an experience in the </text>
<text top="709" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">body. This body was his true teacher. He had to go it alone, but his body, like the dumb ass of St. Francis or the ass of </text>
<text top="723" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">Jesus in whose stable He was born and on which He rode to his last week and body's crucifixion, was His constant </text>
<text top="737" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">companion. Is that not the point of all this body obsession? Does it not say: we are animals with animal hair and teeth </text>
<text top="751" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">and gut. And this animal is a god as so many religious images the world over insist. The animals belong to divinities, </text>
<text top="764" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">who come in the shape of animals, who <i>are </i>animals, saying perhaps that it is the animal in us that is holy. Even the </text>
<text top="778" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">Kundalini itself is a snake. The animal that is divine is the wisdom of nature, or the wisdom of the body, that knows </text>

<text top="43" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">saying that what he was going through was authentic cannot be overvalued. The task of the Western analyst is often just </text>
<text top="57" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">that: to give an affirmation to the experiences which the other person is going through, to take them earnestly, to believe</text>
<text top="71" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">in his inner world and give credit to it. Above all, he mustn't be threatened by it or call it sick. This eminent master said </text>

<text top="99" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">Seventh Centre'). In Jungian analysis, we often say 'you can only take someone else as far as you have gone yourself. </text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">This is a limiting statement and, if taken to heart, is quite depressing both for the student and the analyst. It also shows </text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">how all of us depend upon the very few real masters who have had to go so much of the way alone. It also makes us </text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">value what Gopi Krishna did on his own, and gives our text even further significance as a document which may be of </text>

<text top="181" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">At the end of Chapter Six, our author raises in passing a question about his own <i>sufferings. </i>When one reads the texts of</text>
<text top="195" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">mystics and holy men, as he did, one is struck by all the references to bliss and beauty. And it was the absence of bliss</text>
<text top="208" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">and beauty which made Gopi Krishna vacillate and doubt his own experiences. Again, we can be grateful to him for his</text>
<text top="222" left="9" width="538" height="13" font="5">honesty in recording the bitterness and burning of his own experience, and we can admire him for his absence of</text>
<text top="236" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">resentment. Suffering belongs. The visions in the desert of the Christian Saints, the dark night of the soul of St. John of</text>
<text top="250" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">the Cross, the terrible suffering of the Old Testament prophets, point to the necessity of suffering. To believe that it</text>
<text top="264" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">could be otherwise is—as we know from analytical practice— a remnant of childish idealism. In regard to the archetypal</text>

<text top="292" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">and the Saints, might here have been of more value to our author than his own tradition. In this sense, his work speaks to</text>
<text top="306" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">today and is an excellent bridge to Western experiences in which the expanded or intensified consciousness coming</text>
<text top="320" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">through analysis does not rise as a lotus from a quiet lake, but is riven and torn by neurosis before any light dawns.</text>

<text top="238" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">system and the brain, manifesting itself as the vital energy. The Prana, in modern terminology 'vital energy', assumes </text>
<text top="252" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">different aspects to discharge different functions in the body and circulates in the system in two separate streams, one </text>
<text top="266" left="9" width="546" height="13" font="5">with fervid and the other with frigid effect, clearly perceptible to Yogis in the awakened condition. From my own </text>
<text top="280" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">experience I can also unhesitatingly affirm that there are certainly two main types of vital currents in the body, which </text>
<text top="294" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">have a cooling or heating effect on the system. Prana and Apana exist side by side in the system in every tissue and </text>
<text top="308" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">every cell, the two flowing through the higher nerves and their tiny ramifications as two distinct currents though their </text>
<text top="322" left="9" width="541" height="13" font="5">passage is never felt in the normal state of consciousness, the nerves being accustomed to the flow from the very </text>
<text top="336" left="9" width="110" height="13" font="5">commencement of life.</text>
<text top="362" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">Because of its extremely subtle nature, vital energy has been likened to breath by the ancient authorities on Yoga, and it </text>
<text top="376" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">is maintained that the air we breathe is permeated with both Prana and Apana and that the vital currents flow alternately </text>
<text top="390" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">through the two nostrils along with the air at the time of inhalation and exhalation. As is well known, the air we breathe </text>
<text top="404" left="9" width="540" height="13" font="5">is composed mainly of two gases, oxygen and nitrogen. Oxygen is the chief agent in combustion, burning up the </text>
<text top="418" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">impurities in the blood by its action through the lungs, while nitrogen exerts a moderating effect on its fervour. In view </text>
<text top="432" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">of the fact that the old writers on Kundalini Yoga sometimes use the same term for Prana or Apana, viz. Vayu, which is </text>
<text top="446" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">used for the air we breathe, there is a possibility of confusion being caused that breath and Prana are identical. This is </text>
<text top="460" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">absolutely not the case. Life as we know it on earth is not possible without oxygen, and it is noteworthy that this element</text>
<text top="474" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">is an ingredient of both air and water, the two essential requirements of earthly life. This is a clear indication of the fact </text>
<text top="487" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">that on the terrestrial globe the cosmic vital energy, or Prana Shakti, utilizes oxygen as the main vehicle for its activity. </text>
<text top="501" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">It is possible that biochemistry in the course of its investigations may have to accept at a future date the instrumentality </text>
<text top="515" left="9" width="494" height="13" font="5">of oxygen in all organic phenomena as the main channel for the play of the intelligent vital force Prana.</text>
<text top="541" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">The earth has its own supply of Prana, pervading every atom and every molecule of all the elements and compounds </text>
<text top="555" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">constituting its flaming core, the fiery molten regions below the crust, the hard surface layer with its mountains and seas,</text>
<text top="569" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">and the atmosphere to its outermost fringe. The sun, a vast reservoir of vital energy, is constantly pouring an enormous </text>
<text top="583" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">supply of pranic radiation on earth as a part of its effulgence. The superstitions connected with eclipses may thus have </text>
<text top="597" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">an element of truth, as on all such occasions the pranic emanations from the sun or moon are partially or totally cut off </text>
<text top="611" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">for a time. The changes in the weather and in the vapour and dust content of the atmosphere, which have a marked effect</text>
<text top="625" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">on certain sensitive temperaments, might also be found to cause alterations in the flow of pranic currents. The moon is </text>
<text top="639" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">another big supply centre of Prana for earth. The planets and stars both near and far are all inexhaustible stores of Prana,</text>
<text top="653" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">vitalizing the earth with streams of energy conveyed by their lustre. The pranic emanations from the sun and moon, </text>
<text top="667" left="9" width="542" height="13" font="5">planets and stars, are not all alike, but each has a peculiar characteristic of its own in the same way as the light of </text>
<text top="681" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">heavenly bodies, when analysed on earth after travelling through enormous distances, shows variations in the spectrum </text>

<text top="236" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">According to the religious beliefs in India, dating back to prehistoric times, the existence of Prana as a medium for the </text>

<text top="306" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">consciousness, but rather an inseparable part of the cosmic energy or Shakti which resides in all of them and is the </text>
<text top="320" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">driving force behind all cosmic phenomena, as force in matter and vitality in living organisms; in short, it is the medium </text>
<text top="334" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">by which the cosmic intelligence conducts the unimaginably vast activity of this stupendous world, by which it creates, </text>

<text top="390" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">the inorganic and organic planes. For the sake of convenience and to avoid confusion, the term Prana or Prana-Shakti is </text>
<text top="404" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">generally applied to that aspect of the cosmic energy which operates in the organic sphere, as nervous impulse and </text>
<text top="418" left="9" width="541" height="13" font="5">vitality, while the generic name Shakti is applied to every form of energy, animate and inanimate; in brief, to the </text>
<text top="432" left="9" width="193" height="13" font="5">creative and active aspect of the Reality.</text>
<text top="458" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">In dealing with Kundalini we are concerned only with Prana or Prana-Shakti, sometimes referred to as Shakti for the </text>
<text top="472" left="9" width="534" height="13" font="5">sake of brevity, though, strictly speaking, the designation Shakti is applied to cosmic energy, the creatrix of the </text>
<text top="485" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">universe. Present-day science is being irresistibly led to the conclusion that energy is the basic substance of the physical </text>
<text top="499" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">world. The doubt about the existence of life as a deathless vital medium apart from the corporeal appendages, is as old </text>
<text top="513" left="9" width="523" height="13" font="5">as civilization, and is occasioned mainly by the inexorable nature of physical laws operating on the body, the </text>
<text top="527" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">inevitability of decay and death, the extremely elusive nature of vital principle, the utter impossibility of perceiving it </text>
<text top="541" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">apart from the organic frame, the finality of death as the end of the organism, and above all the utter absence of any </text>
<text top="555" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">demonstrable or incontrovertible proof of survival after bodily death. According to the Yogis, however, the existence of </text>
<text top="569" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">the life energy as a deathless entity becomes subjectively apparent in the superconscious state of Samadhi, and its flow </text>
<text top="583" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">through the nerves can be experienced even before that as soon as certain measures of success are attained in meditation.</text>
<text top="597" left="9" width="548" height="13" font="5">When that happens, a greater demand for it is felt in the concentrated condition of the brain, and to meet this, vital </text>
<text top="611" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">energy or prana, residing in other parts of the body, flows to the head, sometimes to such an extent that even vital organs</text>
<text top="625" left="9" width="514" height="13" font="5">like the heart, lungs, and the digestive system almost cease to function, the pulse and the breathing become </text>
<text top="639" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">imperceptible, and the whole body appears cold and lifeless. With the additional fuel supplied by the enhanced flow of </text>
<text top="653" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">vital energy, the brain becomes more intensely alive; the surface consciousness rises above bodily sensations and its </text>
<text top="667" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">perceptive faculty is vastly enlarged, rendering it cognizant of superphysical existences. In this condition the first object </text>
<text top="681" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">of perception is Prana, experienced as a lustrous, immaterial stuff, sentient and in a state of rapid vibration both within </text>

<text top="460" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">for short periods of time in the beginning, extending the duration with practice, which had a most amazing effect on the </text>
<text top="474" left="9" width="543" height="13" font="5">mind, enabling it to soar to regions of surpassing glory, beyond anything experienced in the crude material world.</text>
<text top="499" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">They named the channel Sushumna, and as the streaming radiance was distinctly felt mounting up from its base, they </text>

<text top="29" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">We can more or less follow the meaning of words, however difficult they may be, which describe mental states common</text>
<text top="43" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">to us all or discuss intellectual problems and abstract propositions based on common experience and knowledge. But the</text>
<text top="57" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">phenomenon which I have tried to explain in these pages is so uncommon and so removed from ordinary affairs that in </text>
<text top="71" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">all probability only a few of those who happen to read this account will have even heard of anything so extraordinary. </text>
<text top="85" left="9" width="546" height="13" font="5">Accomplished masters of Kundalini Yoga, always extremely rare, are almost non-existent now, and the cases of a </text>
<text top="99" left="9" width="546" height="13" font="5">spontaneous type, where the awakening occurs suddenly at some period in life, more often than not end in mental </text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">disorder, which makes a coherent narration of the experience impossible. Under the circumstances it is no wonder that a </text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="331" height="13" font="5">detailed account of this strange experience is not available anywhere.</text>
<text top="153" left="9" width="546" height="13" font="5">I may add, however, that in spite of all this the experience is not as singular or as unauthenticated as might at first </text>
<text top="167" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">appear. There is enough evidence available to suggest that from times immemorial, probably from the very birth of </text>
<text top="181" left="9" width="531" height="13" font="5">civilization and even before that, there have been cases, extremely rare indeed, of the awakening of Kundalini, </text>
<text top="195" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">spontaneously or by means of suitable exercises. In the few cases of the former type where the awakening proceeds </text>
<text top="208" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">towards a healthy culmination, the symptoms being usually mild and the development gradual, as in born mystics, the </text>
<text top="222" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">essential characteristics of the rebirth, which were startlingly apparent in my case, might conceivably escape notice or </text>
<text top="236" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">when noticed may be attributed to other causes due to ignorance about the real one. In the large proportion of cases of </text>
<text top="250" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">the same class where the awakening is morbid, the frenzied expressions of the stricken even when correct would be </text>
<text top="264" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">utterly disregarded as the senseless rubbish of a delirious brain. In the case of awakening brought about by voluntary </text>
<text top="278" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">effort, as the manifestations must generally have occurred behind the walls of inaccessible monasteries or in solitary </text>
<text top="292" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">hermitages or secluded yoga centres in the depths of forests, the extraordinary phenomena attending it were either not </text>
<text top="306" left="9" width="535" height="13" font="5">open to critical observation or, where observed, were treated as a necessary preternatural accompaniment to the </text>
<text top="320" left="9" width="547" height="13" font="5">adventure and hence not regarded seriously as something important to record and communicate or, considered too </text>
<text top="334" left="9" width="447" height="13" font="5">sacred to be divulged, were kept a closely guarded secret accessible to none save the initiates.</text>
<text top="360" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">Accordingly labouring under the difficulty of describing in this critical age of science a bizarre mental phenomenon </text>
<text top="374" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">never described in detail before, I am compelled for reasons of prudence to keep back much that should have found a </text>
<text top="388" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">place in this work and which, I am sure, will fall within the experience of many of those who, like me, chance to kindle </text>
<text top="402" left="9" width="541" height="13" font="5">the serpent fire accidentally without a preparatory period of training in the days to come. Acting on this plan it is </text>
<text top="416" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">sufficient for me to say, without narrating many of the almost uncanny happenings which I witnessed within myself, that</text>
<text top="430" left="9" width="541" height="13" font="5">during the following months my mental condition continued to be the same as already described, but there was a </text>
<text top="444" left="9" width="524" height="13" font="5">perceptible improvement in my bodily health, and I found my former strength and vigour gradually returning.</text>
<text top="469" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">The Government Offices moved from Jammu to Srinagar, the summer capital of the State, usually in the month of May, </text>
<text top="483" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">but being on leave and finding myself unable to withstand the deleterious effects of heat in the weakened state of my </text>
<text top="497" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">nerves, I left for Kashmir in early April. The change did me good. The valley was thick with blossoms and the crisp </text>
<text top="511" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">spring air filled with fragrance had an invigorating effect upon me. There was absolutely no change in the constant </text>
<text top="525" left="9" width="542" height="13" font="5">movements of the radiant current or in the intensified behaviour of the glow in my head. On the other hand, their </text>
<text top="539" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">activity was more intensified. But my mental strength, poise, and power of endurance, which seemed to have been </text>
<text top="553" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">completely depleted, came back to me in part, and I found myself able to take a lively interest in conversations. What </text>
<text top="567" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">was more precious to me, the deep feelings of love for my family, which had appeared to be dead, stirred in my heart </text>
<text top="581" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">again. Within a few weeks after arriving, I found myself able to take long walks and to attend to ordinary affairs not </text>
<text top="595" left="9" width="520" height="13" font="5">requiring too much exertion; but still I could not read attentively for long and continued to have a fear of the </text>
<text top="609" left="9" width="359" height="13" font="5">supernatural. I persistently avoided thinking of or talking about the subject.</text>
<text top="635" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">My former appetite returned and I could eat everything I used to previously without any fear of a few morsels more or </text>
<text top="649" left="9" width="527" height="13" font="5">less creating a storm in my interior. I could even prolong the interval between meals, but not too long without </text>
<text top="663" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">discomfort. By the time my office opened at Srinagar I had gained enough strength and endurance to have the assurance </text>
<text top="677" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">that I could again take up my official duties without the risk of aggravating my mental condition or making myself </text>
<text top="691" left="9" width="548" height="13" font="5">ridiculous by exhibiting a lack of efficiency in my work or any sign of abnormality in my behaviour. When I went </text>
<text top="705" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">through the papers on my desk, I noticed that my memory was unimpaired and the awful experience I had undergone </text>
<text top="719" left="9" width="212" height="13" font="5">had in no way adversely affected my ability.</text>
<text top="745" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">I was easily fatigued, however, and became restless after only a few hours of attentive application. After a prolonged </text>
<text top="758" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">spell of mental work, I invariably found after closing my eyes and listening internally that the luminous circle was more </text>
<text top="772" left="9" width="542" height="13" font="5">extended and the buzzing in the ears louder than usual. This served as an indication that I was still not capable of </text>
<text top="786" left="9" width="528" height="13" font="5">maintaining a sustained state of attention for lengthy periods and that I should proceed with caution to avoid a </text>
<text top="800" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">recrudescence of the previous symptoms. Accordingly, I decided to alternate spells of work with intervals of relaxation </text>
<text top="814" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">by chatting with my colleagues, by looking out of the window, or by moving from the office into the busy street outside </text>
</page>
<page number="41" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="842" width="595">
<text top="3" left="9" width="297" height="13" font="5">which offered a large variety of objects to divert my attention.</text>
<text top="29" left="9" width="527" height="13" font="5">I do not know how it happened that even in that extremely abnormal state of my mind, needing constantly the </text>
<text top="43" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">application of new measures to adapt it to changing circumstances, I often hit upon the right procedure to deal with </text>
<text top="57" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">unexpected and difficult situations arising in my day-to-day contacts. If I had done so much as even breathed to others a </text>
<text top="71" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">word about my abnormality and the bizarre manifestations which were now a regular feature of my life, I might have </text>
<text top="85" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">been labelled as a lunatic and treated accordingly, meeting ridicule instead of compassion. If I had tried to make capital </text>
<text top="99" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">out of the mysterious occurrence and pretended a knowledge of the occult, which I did not in reality possess, I might </text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="541" height="13" font="5">have been hailed as a saint and pestered day and night by people seeking a miraculous way of escape out of their </text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="538" height="13" font="5">difficulties. Beyond a few hints which I let drop to some of my relatives in the very beginning when I was taken </text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">completely aback by the strange malady, and beyond revealing my condition as well as I could to a few Yoga experts </text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">for guidance, I maintained a strict reserve about my abnormal state and never referred to it in my conversation with </text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">intimate friends, although even in my most sanguine moments the fear of impending madness never left me completely.</text>
<text top="195" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">The magnitude of the risk that one has to run in the event of a powerful awakening all of a sudden, can be gauged from </text>
<text top="208" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">the fact that simultaneously with the release of the new energy, profound functional and structural changes begin to </text>
<text top="222" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">occur in the delicate fabric of the nervous system with such rapidity and violence as to be sufficient to cause unhinging </text>
<text top="236" left="9" width="539" height="13" font="5">of the brain instantaneously if the organism as a whole does not possess enough power of adjustment to bear the </text>
<text top="250" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">tremendous strain, as actually happens in a large percentage of cases. Among the inmates of mental hospitals there are </text>
<text top="264" left="9" width="446" height="13" font="5">often some who owe their malady to a prematurely active or morbidly functioning Kundalini.</text>
<text top="290" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">With the restoration of my faculties and the growing clarity of mind I began to speculate about my condition. I read all </text>
<text top="304" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">that came my way pertaining to Kundalini and Yoga, but did not come across any account of a similar phenomenon. The</text>
<text top="318" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">darting warm and cold currents, the effulgence in the head, the unearthly sounds in the ears, and the gripping fear were </text>
<text top="332" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">all mentioned, but there was no sign in me of clairvoyance or of ecstasy or of communication with disembodied spirits </text>
<text top="346" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">or of any other extraordinary psychic gift, all considered to be the distinctive characteristics of an awakened Kundalini </text>
<text top="360" left="9" width="110" height="13" font="5">from the earliest times.</text>
<text top="386" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">Often in the silence and darkness of my room at night I found myself looking with dread at horribly disfigured faces and</text>
<text top="400" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">distorted forms bending and twisting into shapes, appearing and disappearing rapidly in the shining medium, eddying </text>
<text top="414" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">and swirling in and around me. They left me trembling with fear, unable to account for their presence. At times, though </text>
<text top="428" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">such occurrences were rare, I could perceive within the luminous mist a brighter radiance emanating from a luciferous, </text>
<text top="442" left="9" width="547" height="13" font="5">ethereal shape, with a hardly distinguishable face and figure, but nevertheless a presence, emitting a lustre so soft, </text>
<text top="456" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">enchanting, and soothing that on such occasions my mind overflowed with happiness and an indescribable divine peace </text>
<text top="469" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">filled every fibre of my being. Strangely enough, on every such occasion the memory of the primary vision, which </text>
<text top="483" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">occurred on the first day of the awakening, came vividly to me as if to hearten me in the midst of despondency with a </text>
<text top="497" left="9" width="460" height="13" font="5">fleeting glimpse of a supercondition towards which I was being painfully and inexorably drawn.</text>
<text top="523" left="9" width="541" height="13" font="5">I was not sure at that time whether the visions afforded actual glimpses of supermundane existence or were mere </text>
<text top="537" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">figments of my now highly excited and virtually glowing imagination. I did not know what was making me perennially </text>
<text top="551" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">conscious of luminosity as if my own intangible mental stuff had been metamorphosed into a radiant substance and this </text>
<text top="565" left="9" width="429" height="13" font="5">metamorphosis of the mind substance was responsible for radiancy in the thought images.</text>
<text top="591" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">I continued to attend to my household and official duties, gaining more and more strength every day. After a few more </text>
<text top="605" left="9" width="535" height="13" font="5">weeks I was able to work attentively for hours with my now transformed mental equipment without feeling any </text>
<text top="619" left="9" width="536" height="13" font="5">distressing symptoms. But there was no perceptible change in my general outlook or efficiency, and barring the </text>
<text top="633" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">introduction of this mysterious and incomprehensible factor into my life, I was the same as before. Gradually, as my </text>
<text top="647" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">power of endurance developed and moments of fear grew rarer, I became more reconciled to my apparent abnormality </text>
<text top="661" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">which ceased to engage my attention throughout the day, and I was left free to occupy myself as I pleased. I was not </text>
<text top="675" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">now as acutely conscious of the movements of the newly generated vital current in my spinal cord and other nerve </text>
<text top="689" left="9" width="131" height="13" font="5">tracks as I had been before.</text>
<text top="715" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">In the course of time the passage of the current through the scattered nervous threads became less perceptible and often I</text>
<text top="729" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">did not notice it at all. I could now devote myself attentively to any work for hours. Comparing my later stable mental </text>
<text top="743" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">condition with what it had been in the initial stages, after the crisis, the realization came to me that I had escaped from </text>
<text top="756" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">the clutches of insanity by the narrowest margin and that I owed my deliverance not to any effort of mine but to the </text>
<text top="770" left="9" width="545" height="13" font="5">benign disposition of the energy itself. In the primary stages, particularly before the crisis, for certain very cogent </text>
<text top="784" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">reasons the vital current appeared to be acting erratically and blindly like the swollen water of a flooded stream which, </text>
<text top="798" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">pouring out through a breach in the embankment, rushes madly here and there trying to scour out a new channel for its </text>
<text top="812" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">passage. Years later I had an inkling of what had actually happened and could guess at the marvel lying hidden in the </text>

	<fontspec id="10" size="9" family="Times" color="#000000"/>
<text top="3" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">human body, unsuspected, waiting for the needed invocation from the owner and a favourable opportunity to leap to </text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="542" height="13" font="5">action, when, ploughing its way through the flesh like the diverted stream in flood, it creates new channels in the </text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="528" height="13" font="5">nervous system and the brain to endow the fortunate individual with unbelievable mental and spiritual powers.</text>
<text top="57" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">The six months of that summer spent in Kashmir passed without any remarkable event or noteworthy change in me. The</text>
<text top="71" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">stir caused by my strange indisposition died down gradually. Most of the men who had any knowledge of it attributed </text>
<text top="85" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">my sudden breakdown to mental causes. But as a whisper had gone round in some quarters that my strange distemper </text>
<text top="99" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">was the outcome of yoga practices, intimately connected with Kundalini, the curious came to see me on one pretext or </text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">another, trying to elicit further information to assure themselves by the exhibition of some supernatural feat on my part </text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="531" height="13" font="5">that I had really crossed the boundary which separates the human from the divine. For many of them, the mere </text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">awakening of the serpent power meant a precipitate plunge into the supernatural. They were not blameworthy. Most </text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">men seem to have the notion that it is but a step from human to cosmic consciousness, a step which one can take all at </text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">once with assistance from a teacher or with the aid of spiritual exercises as easily and safely as one crosses a threshold </text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="200" height="13" font="5">leading from a smaller into a larger room.</text>
<text top="208" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">This fallacious idea is often bolstered by incompetent guides, trading on the credulity of mankind, who claim knowledge</text>
<text top="222" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">of yoga and ability to bring about positive results in their disciples, themselves utterly unaware of the fact that yoga as a </text>
<text top="236" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">progressive science has been dead for the last hundreds of years and that beyond a few parrot-like recitations from the </text>
<text top="250" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">works of ancient masters they know no more about it than the uninformed whom they profess to teach. In olden days the</text>
<text top="264" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">serious and difficult nature of the task was fully recognized and the aspirants who set about it took full care to divest </text>
<text top="278" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">themselves of all worldly responsibilities and to develop a stoical attitude of mind, prepared to meet all eventualities </text>
<text top="292" left="9" width="200" height="13" font="5">without flinching or yielding under stress.</text>
<text top="318" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">To the inquiries directed to gathering more information about my experience for frivolous reasons, I usually turned a </text>
<text top="332" left="9" width="544" height="13" font="5">deaf ear, maintaining a reserve which has continued to this day. Failing to gain satisfaction for their curiosity and </text>
<text top="346" left="9" width="548" height="13" font="5">finding no remarkable change in me, the story of my spiritual adventure was treated as a myth, and to some I even </text>
<text top="360" left="9" width="447" height="13" font="5">became an object of ridicule for having mistaken a physical ailment for a divine dispensation.</text>
<text top="386" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">At the end of summer I was almost as strong as before. Barring the luminous currents and the radiance in my head, I </text>
<text top="400" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">marked no other change in myself and felt none the worse for my awful adventure save that at certain times, usually in </text>
<text top="414" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">the afternoon, the passage of the current became disturbingly perceptible, accompanied by a slight uneasiness in the </text>
<text top="428" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">head. At such times I usually experienced a difficulty in applying myself attentively to any task and often spent the </text>
<text top="442" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">interval in talking or strolling in the open. Sometimes on such occasions I noticed a greater pressure on the nerve centres</text>
<text top="456" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">in the cardiac and hepatic regions, especially the latter, as if a greater flow of the radiation were being forced into the </text>
<text top="469" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">organ to increase its activity. There was no other indication of anything remarkable or unusual in me. I slept well, ate </text>
<text top="483" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">heartily, and in order to overcome the effects on my body of several months of forced inactivity, took a little exercise to </text>
<text top="497" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">which I had been accustomed since boyhood, avoiding undue strain and exhaustion. But after the hours spent in the </text>
<text top="511" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">office, I felt no inclination to read in the evening, as had been my habit in the past, or to do any mental work. Treating </text>
<text top="525" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">this as a hint from within not to tax the brain any further, I retired usually to my room for relaxation and rest soon after </text>
<text top="539" left="9" width="33" height="13" font="5">dinner.</text>
<text top="565" left="9" width="548" height="13" font="5">Towards the end of October 1939, I made preparations for my departure to Jammu with the office. I felt myself so </text>
<text top="579" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">thoroughly fit for the journey and subsequent sojourn there for six months all by myself that for reasons of her health I </text>
<text top="593" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">left my wife, my one unfailing partner in all my vicissitudes, in Kashmir, confident of my own ability to look after </text>
<text top="607" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">myself. I did not realize at that time that I was taking a grave risk in not having her with me when away from home, that </text>
<text top="621" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">without my knowledge the stormy force released in my body was still as actively at work, and that though I was not </text>
<text top="635" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">acutely cognizant of its movements, the strain on my vital organs was no less heavy than it had been before. The thought</text>

<text top="485" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">application and study, and made to accommodate more information and assimilate more facts, but with the exception of </text>
<text top="499" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">gifted individuals fashioned in a slightly different form, it cannot be made to transcend the limits of the native state of </text>
<text top="513" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">consciousness exhibited by it and to step into the next higher stratum, able to perceive what was imperceptible and to </text>
<text top="527" left="9" width="238" height="13" font="5">know what was unknowable before the transition.</text>
<text top="553" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">The question to be answered is whether this transition from one sphere of consciousness to another can be effected and</text>
<text top="567" left="9" width="548" height="13" font="5">whether there are any authentic instances of it during recent times. The answer to the first part of the question is an</text>
<text top="581" left="9" width="541" height="13" font="5">emphatic 'yes'. The whole armoury of every system of Yoga, of every occult creed and of every esoteric religious</text>
<text top="595" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">doctrine is directed to this end. The only shortcoming, which makes the claim appear absurd and fantastic to a strictly</text>
<text top="609" left="9" width="543" height="13" font="5">scientific mind, is that the biological process by which the change can be brought about has not been explained or</text>
<text top="623" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">probably even thought of under the false notion, already discussed, that the human mind can win entry to supersensory</text>
<text top="637" left="9" width="532" height="13" font="5">realms without affecting the body in any way. Almost all the methods in use from time immemorial for gaining</text>
<text top="651" left="9" width="529" height="13" font="5">visionary experience or supersensory perception—concentration, breathing exercises, postures, prayer, fasting,</text>
<text top="665" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">asceticism and the like—affect both the organic frame and the mind. It is, therefore, but reasonable to suppose that any</text>
<text top="679" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">change brought about by their means in the sphere of thought must also be preceded by alterations in the chemistry of</text>
<text top="693" left="9" width="44" height="13" font="5">the body.</text>
<text top="719" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">The ancient authorities on Yoga, though aware of the important role played by the physical organism in developing </text>
<text top="733" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">supersensory channels of cognition and fully conversant with the methods for diverting its energies in this direction, </text>
<text top="747" left="9" width="540" height="13" font="5">were far more interested in the spiritual than in the physical side of the science, attached little significance to the </text>
<text top="760" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">biological changes occurring in the flesh as compared to the resulting momentous developments in the realm of mind. </text>
<text top="774" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">The general level of knowledge in those days and the tendencies of the time also precluded the possibility of such an </text>
<text top="788" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">investigation. Even the advocates of Kundalini Yoga, starting with the discipline and purification of internal organs, </text>
<text top="802" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">have failed to give that status to the corporeal frame as the sole channel for success in Yoga, leading to transcendence, </text>

<text top="236" left="9" width="344" height="20" font="9"><i>Commentary to Chapters Seven, Eight and Nine</i></text>
<text top="269" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">In Chapter Seven, the text takes up <i>prana </i>again, this time more metaphysically. In Chapter Eight, we come to another of</text>
<text top="283" left="9" width="540" height="13" font="5">the traditional problems associated with mystical experiences and that is the question of <i>secrecy. </i>Our author was </text>
<text top="297" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">strongly moved not to tell anyone of what he was going through, not even his wife. Again, this rigid secrecy is typical of</text>
<text top="311" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">one in the throes of a paranoid delusion. To open the secret is in a sense what we call 'reality testing'. If it were laughed </text>
<text top="325" left="9" width="537" height="13" font="5">at, argued away, diagnosed as sick, a whole world would collapse. But more, there is something in the nature of </text>
<text top="339" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">mystical experiences that demands secrecy, as if the archetype behind the events which are in process needs a certain </text>
<text top="353" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">tension in order for it to be fulfilled. The alchemists envisioned this secrecy in their image of the closed vessel. In many </text>
<text top="367" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">fairy tales the hero or heroine is ordered not to say anything until the ordeal is over. In the Greek religious mysteries the </text>
<text top="381" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">participants were threatened with death if they told what happened. Initiation rites also require sworn secrecy. Secrecy </text>
<text top="394" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">intensifies, allowing what is coming to fruition to swell and grow in silence so that later it can be brought forth and </text>
<text top="408" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">shown. Secrecy is the ground of revelation, making revelation possible; what happens secretly in the wings, behind the </text>
<text top="422" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">scenes, makes possible the drama when the curtains open and the lights go up. The urge to withhold and keep back is </text>
<text top="436" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">part of being witness to the uncanny. What to hold back, when to tell, whom to tell, how to tell, these questions fraught </text>
<text top="450" left="9" width="545" height="13" font="5">with peril lie along the razor's edge between deluded paranoid isolation and individual strength, between arrogant </text>
<text top="464" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">private esotericism and uncertain loneliness of silence. Secrecy, as well, gives individuality; what everybody knows is </text>
<text top="478" left="9" width="380" height="13" font="5">no longer individual. Without our individual secrets we are only public ciphers.</text>
<text top="504" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">He tells us in Chapter Eight that 'at night I found myself looking with dread at horribly disfigured faces and distorted </text>
<text top="518" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">forms bending and twisting into awful shapes. ... They left me trembling with fear, unable to account for their presence.' </text>
<text top="532" left="9" width="542" height="13" font="5">The encounter with distorted human figures in a night-world seems another authentic necessity. It is evidently so </text>
<text top="546" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">important that Homer, Virgil and Dante describe similar phenomena in the descent into Hades of their heroes. It is part </text>
<text top="560" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">of their journey. We find parallels in analysis. After a certain integration has taken place, there sometimes occur dreams </text>
<text top="574" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">of a hospital ward with ill and maimed, or a large photo of all the family members that oppresses the dreamer thereafter </text>
<text top="588" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">for days, or one's early school class, or club, appear <i>en masse </i>in the analyst's waiting-room. These shades too need </text>
<text top="602" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">transformation; they are parts that have not been redeemed despite the integration achieved by the conscious personality </text>
<text top="616" left="9" width="538" height="13" font="5">and its ego. Especially tormented in the Underworld are the unburied dead, those configurations passed away or </text>
<text top="630" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">repressed out of awareness but still not over and done with, hauntingly lingering at the threshold. The manifestation of </text>
<text top="644" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">these 'awful shapes' reminds heroic consciousness that there are still shadows in the cave even if one has seen the light </text>
<text top="658" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">oneself. The psyche is separable; even if 'I' have moved, there are some tormented 'me's' left behind in hell. In Greek </text>
<text top="671" left="9" width="535" height="13" font="5">thought the souls in Hades were regarded as moist, preponderating in the wet element of generation; life-giving </text>
<text top="685" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">moisture. Our author says these faces and figures eddied and swirled using the language of water for their motions. </text>
<text top="699" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">Perhaps these parts had not yet been through the cooking process, not yet been volatilized, and so they may herald a new</text>
<text top="713" left="9" width="207" height="13" font="5">descent into hell's torment and drying fires.</text>
<text top="739" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">At this time he notes that the 'current' seemed to have as its aim the <i>liver. </i>The liver has always been an important symbol</text>
<text top="753" left="9" width="545" height="13" font="5">in occult physiology. As the largest organ, the one containing the most blood, it was regarded as the darkest, least </text>
<text top="767" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">penetrable part of man's innards. Thus it was considered to contain the secret of fate and was used for fortune-telling. In </text>
<text top="781" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">Plato, and in later physiology, the liver represented the darkest passions, particularly the bloody, smoky ones of wrath, </text>
<text top="795" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">jealousy, and greed which drive men to action. Thus the liver meant the impulsive attachment to life itself. From this </text>
<text top="809" left="9" width="484" height="13" font="5">angle, the renewed interest in the liver by our author could predict a revivification of general activity.</text>
</page>
<page number="47" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="842" width="595">
<text top="3" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">But if the currents that run towards the liver (and heart, too) indicate emotional activity, what about the pull downward</text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">of the shapes in hell? The two tendencies—downward to the disfigured night-world and outward into activity—are not</text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">as contradictory as they seem. In neoplatonic thought the moist souls are precisely those which are still involved with</text>
<text top="45" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">the generative principle, the life-cycle of binding kleshas. The souls in Hades want blood and eat red-coloured food, i.e.</text>
<text top="59" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">they hunger for life. The activation of the liver may thus be seen as a movement towards feeding distorted fragments of</text>
<text top="73" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">unlived life that still longed to live, but which in the long run of any Indian spiritual discipline must be yoked to the</text>
<text top="87" left="9" width="142" height="13" font="5">single aim of 'pure cognition'.</text>
<text top="153" left="9" width="89" height="20" font="3">Chapter Ten</text>
<text top="185" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">I RETURNED to Jammu in a cheerful frame of mind, restored almost to my normal physical and mental health. The </text>
<text top="199" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">fear of the supernatural and antipathy towards religion that had been constantly present during the first few months had </text>
<text top="213" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">partially disappeared. I could not for a long time account for this sudden revulsion of what had been a deep-rooted </text>
<text top="227" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">feeling in me and even during the days of acute disturbance was surprised at this change in myself. It was not only </text>
<text top="241" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">because my irrepressible desire for religious experience had landed me in an awful predicament that I felt the fear and </text>
<text top="255" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">the aversion, but there seemed to have actually occurred an inexplicable alteration in the very depths of my personality, </text>
<text top="269" left="9" width="207" height="13" font="5">for which I was at a loss to assign a reason.</text>
<text top="295" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">Devout and God-fearing until my abnormal condition, I had lost all feelings of love and veneration for the divine, all </text>
<text top="309" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">respect for the sacred and the holy, and all interest in the scriptural and sacramental. The very idea of the supernatural </text>
<text top="323" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">had become hateful and I did not allow my thoughts to dwell on it even for a moment. From a devotee I became an </text>
<text top="337" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">inveterate enemy of faith and felt seething resentment against those whom I saw going to or coming from places of </text>
<text top="351" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">worship. I had changed entirely, devoid completely of every religious sentiment, turned into a rank atheist, a violent </text>
<text top="365" left="9" width="284" height="13" font="5">heretic, the very antithesis of the religious and the spiritual.</text>
<text top="390" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">In the early stages, desperately engaged in a neck and neck race, with death on one side and insanity on the other, I had </text>
<text top="404" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">neither the time nor the mental disposition to think seriously about this sudden disappearance of a powerful impulse </text>
<text top="418" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">which had dominated my thought from a very early age. As my mind grew clearer I wondered more and more at this </text>
<text top="432" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">quite unexpected alteration. When on the restoration of my general health, particularly the feelings of love, the distaste </text>
<text top="446" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">for the supernatural still persisted and I found myself empty of religious desire, as if washed clean of it, I became uneasy</text>
<text top="460" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">at the thought that it might not be Kundalini, considered to be the inexhaustible fount of divine love and the perennial </text>
<text top="474" left="9" width="544" height="13" font="5">source of spirituality, which was active in me, but some evil force of darkness dragging me towards the depths of </text>
<text top="488" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">irreli-giosity and impiety. At such times the words of the Brahmin Sadhu whom I had consulted during the preceding </text>
<text top="502" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">winter in a state of desperation always came back with an ominous significance. He had said slowly, emphasizing every </text>
<text top="516" left="9" width="541" height="13" font="5">word to make it sink deep into my terribly agitated mind, that the symptoms I had mentioned could in no way be </text>
<text top="530" left="9" width="542" height="13" font="5">attributed to Kundalini, the ocean of bliss, as she could never be associated with anything in the nature of pain or </text>
<text top="544" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">disturbance, and that my malady was most probably due to the vicious influence of some evilly disposed elemental </text>
<text top="558" left="9" width="547" height="13" font="5">spirit. I had been horrified at the words, which, spoken with certainty to a man fighting desperately with madness, </text>
<text top="572" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">spelled death for any spark of hope left in him; and they often came back to me in the darkest moments to shut out the </text>
<text top="586" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">last glimmer of reason still struggling for existence. With sanity restored, but still strangely altered by a strongly marked</text>
<text top="600" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">characteristic, the idea recurred with overwhelming force to harass me when I failed to find a satisfactory explanation </text>
<text top="614" left="9" width="71" height="13" font="5">for the change.</text>
<text top="640" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">Shortly before coming to Jammu I had begun to feel vaguely the dim stirrings of the apparently dead impulse. This </text>
<text top="654" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">happened usually in the early hours of morning, immediately on awakening from sleep, as if the refreshed state of the </text>
<text top="667" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">brain afforded an opportunity to the vanished urge to make a shadowy appearance for a brief interval. At such moments </text>
<text top="681" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">my thoughts usually dwelt on the life stories of certain mystics whose utterances had once made a powerful appeal to </text>
<text top="695" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">me. I had wholly forgotten them during the preceding months and when recalled by accident the remembrance failed to </text>
<text top="709" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">evoke any warmth. I usually turned my thoughts to other things to avoid thinking of them. Now their memory returned </text>
<text top="723" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">as of old for a moment, the sweetness tinctured with a certain bitterness, for they had said nothing clearly of the dread </text>
<text top="737" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">ordeal which they too must have gone through in one form or another, nothing about the dangers and pitfalls of the path </text>
<text top="751" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">which they too must have travelled and which must be common to reach a goal open to all. But if they had suffered as I </text>
<text top="765" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">did or even a fraction of it, and come out of the tribulation to compose inspiring rhymes which had captivated my heart </text>
<text top="779" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">at the very first hearing, they were indeed worthy of the greatest homage, far above and beyond a man like me, shaken </text>
<text top="793" left="9" width="159" height="13" font="5">and shattered by the same ordeal.</text>
<text top="819" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">A few weeks after my arrival in Jammu I noticed that the gap was quickly filling and that my religious ideas, sentiments,</text>
</page>
<page number="48" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="842" width="595">
<text top="3" left="9" width="525" height="13" font="5">and memories were all reviving rapidly. I felt again the same deep urge for religious experience and the same </text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="521" height="13" font="5">all-absorbing interest in the supernatural and the mystical. I could again sit all by myself brooding on the yet </text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">unanswered problem of being and the riddle of my own existence or listen to devotional songs and mystical poetry with </text>
<text top="45" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">undiminished rapture from the start to finish without the least sign of disturbance or any symptoms of haunting terror. </text>
<text top="59" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">When it happened, the overhanging cloud of a malevolent spirit leading me towards degradation disappeared and my </text>
<text top="73" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">heart expanded in gratitude to the mysterious power working in me. It was only now that I really began to recognize </text>
<text top="87" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">myself, the being who about a year before had sat cross-legged in meditation, bent on invoking the supersensible, little </text>
<text top="101" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">knowing in his ignorance that the average human frame of today, emasculated by a faulty civilization and enervated by </text>
<text top="115" left="9" width="540" height="13" font="5">uncontrolled ambitions and desires, is not strong enough to bear the splendour of the mighty vision without long </text>
<text top="129" left="9" width="218" height="13" font="5">preparatory training, austerity, and discipline.</text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">Slowly it began to dawn upon me that the torture I suffered in the beginning was caused by the unexpected release of the</text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">powerful vital energy through a wrong nerve, <i>pingala, </i>and that the hot blast coursing through my nerve and brain cells </text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">would have undoubtedly led to death but for the miraculous intervention at the last minute. Later on, my suffering was </text>
<text top="197" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">probably due, firstly, to the damage already sustained by my nervous system; secondly, to the fact that I was entirely </text>
<text top="210" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">uninitiated into the mystery; and thirdly and mainly, to the circumstance that my body, though above the average in </text>
<text top="224" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">muscular strength, was not sufficiently developed internally to withstand with impunity the sudden onrush of a much </text>
<text top="238" left="9" width="535" height="13" font="5">more dynamic and potent life energy than that to which the average human body is normally accustomed. I had </text>
<text top="252" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">experienced enough to realize that this powerful vital force, once let loose even by accident, cannot be restrained from </text>
<text top="266" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">carrying one onward and upward towards a higher and more penetrating consciousness for which it is the one and the </text>
<text top="280" left="9" width="547" height="13" font="5">only instrument. The awakening of Kundalini, it seemed to me, implied the introduction into the human body of a </text>
<text top="294" left="9" width="513" height="13" font="5">higher form of nerve force by the constant sublimation of the human seed, leading ultimately to the radiant </text>
<text top="308" left="9" width="447" height="13" font="5">transcendental consciousness aglow ever after in the transformed brain of successful initiates.</text>
<text top="334" left="9" width="537" height="13" font="5">I speculated in this manner without being sure about the correctness of my surmises. I had undergone a singular </text>
<text top="348" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">experience, but how could I be sure that I was not the victim of an abnormal pathological condition, peculiar to me </text>
<text top="362" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">alone? How could I be sure that I was not suffering from a continuous hallucinatory affliction in this particular respect </text>
<text top="376" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">while normal in other ways, the unexpected result, in my case, of prolonged concentration and too much absorption in </text>
<text top="390" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">the occult? If I had within reach a recorded experience even distantly similar to mine or a really competent teacher to </text>
<text top="404" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">guide me, my doubts would have been resolved then and there, by which the whole course of my life might have been </text>
<text top="418" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">different and I might have been saved another equally long and equally awful period of agony, as the one I had just </text>
<text top="432" left="9" width="69" height="13" font="5">come through.</text>
<text top="458" left="9" width="529" height="13" font="5">As I still failed to notice the development of any extraordinary talent or supernormal faculty, I continued to be </text>
<text top="472" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">tormented by serious doubts about the actual nature of the abnormality of which I was the victim. The ever-present </text>
<text top="485" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">radiation, bathing my head with lustre and glowing along the path of countless nerves in the body, streaming here and </text>
<text top="499" left="9" width="537" height="13" font="5">there in a most wonderful and sometimes awe-inspiring manner, had little in common with the effulgent visions </text>
<text top="513" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">described by yogis and mystics. Beyond the spectacle of a luminous circle around the head, which was now constant in </text>
<text top="527" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">me, and an extended consciousness, I felt and saw nothing extraordinary in the least approaching the supernatural, but </text>
<text top="541" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">for all practical purposes was the same man that I had always been. The only difference was that I now saw the world </text>
<text top="555" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">reflected in a larger mental mirror. It is extremely difficult for me to express adequately this change in my cognitive </text>
<text top="569" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">apparatus. The best I can do is to say that it appeared as if an enlarged picture of the world was now being formed in the </text>
<text top="583" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">mind, not enlarged in the sense of magnification by a microscope, but as if the world image was now presented by a </text>
<text top="597" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">wider conscious surface than before. In other words, the knowing self appeared to have acquired distinctly extended </text>
<text top="611" left="9" width="58" height="13" font="5">proportions.</text>
<text top="637" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">It was at an early stage that I had become conscious of this inexplicable alteration. At that time I was not in a condition </text>
<text top="651" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">to give it serious thought and took it for granted that the change was brought about by the luminous vapour streaming </text>
<text top="665" left="9" width="540" height="13" font="5">into my brain. As already mentioned, the dimensions of the shining mist in my head varied constantly, causing a </text>
<text top="679" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">widening and shrinking of consciousness. This rapid alteration in the perceptive mirror, accompanied by an ever-present</text>
<text top="693" left="9" width="542" height="13" font="5">sense of deadening fear, had been the first acutely distressing and completely bewildering feature of my uncanny </text>
<text top="707" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">experience. As time wore on, the extension became more and more apparent, with less frequent contractions, but even in</text>
<text top="721" left="9" width="538" height="13" font="5">the narrowest state of perception, my consciousness was wider than before. I could not fail to mark this startling </text>
<text top="735" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">alteration in myself as it occurred abruptly, carrying me from one conscious state to another almost overnight. If the </text>
<text top="749" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">transition had taken place gradually, without the other accompanying factors like the radiating spinal currents and the </text>
<text top="762" left="9" width="533" height="13" font="5">extraordinary sensations that made the whole phenomenon so striking and bizarre, I might not have noticed the </text>
<text top="776" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">extension at all, as one does not notice the extremely slight daily changes in one's own face which immediately strike a </text>
<text top="790" left="9" width="141" height="13" font="5">friend after a long separation.</text>
<text top="816" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">As the alteration in the state of my consciousness is the most important feature of my experience to which I wish to </text>

<text top="3" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">draw attention, having far-reaching results, it is necessary to say more about this extraordinary development, which for a</text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">long time I considered to be an abnormality or delusion. The state of exalted and extended consciousness, permeated </text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">with an inexpressible, supermundane happiness which I experienced on the first appearance of the serpent fire in me, </text>
<text top="45" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">was an internal phenomenon, subjective in nature, indicating an expansion of the field of awareness, or the cognitive </text>
<text top="59" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">self, formless, invisible, and infinitely subtle, the observer in the body, always beyond scrutiny, impossible to delineate </text>
<text top="73" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">or depict. From a unit of consciousness, dominated by the ego, to which I was habituated from childhood, I expanded all</text>
<text top="87" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">at once into a glowing conscious circle, growing larger and larger, until a maximum was reached, the 'I' remaining as it </text>
<text top="101" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">was, but instead of a confining unit, now itself encompassed by a shining conscious globe of vast dimensions. For want </text>
<text top="115" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">of a better simile, I should say that from a tiny glow the awareness in me became a large radiating pool of light, the 'I' </text>
<text top="129" left="9" width="542" height="13" font="5">immersed in it yet fully cognizant of the radiantly blissful volume of consciousness all around, both near and far. </text>
<text top="143" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">Speaking more precisely, there was ego consciousness as well as a vastly extended field of awareness, existing side by </text>
<text top="157" left="9" width="125" height="13" font="5">side, both distinct yet one.</text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">This remarkable phenomenon, indelibly imprinted upon my memory, as vivid when recalled today as at the time of </text>
<text top="197" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">occurrence, was never repeated in all its original splendour until long after. During the following agonizing weeks and </text>
<text top="210" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">months there was absolutely no resemblance between my initial experience and the subsequent extremely disquieting </text>
<text top="224" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">mental condition, beyond the fact that I was painfully aware that an expansion had somehow taken place in the original </text>
<text top="238" left="9" width="321" height="13" font="5">area of my consciousness subject frequently to partial contractions.</text>
<text top="264" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">At the time of my coming to Jammu I had gained my equilibrium of mind and soon after was restored fully to myself, </text>
<text top="278" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">with all my individual traits and peculiarities. But the unmistakable alteration in my cognitive faculty, which I had </text>
<text top="292" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">noticed for some time and of which I was constantly reminded when contemplating an external object or an internal </text>
<text top="306" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">mental image, underwent no modification except that with the passage of time the luminous circle in my head grew </text>
<text top="320" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">larger and larger by imperceptible degrees, with a corresponding increase in the area of consciousness. It was certain </text>
<text top="334" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">that I was now looking at the universe with a perceptibly enlarged mental surface and that, in consequence, the world </text>
<text top="348" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">image which I perceived was reflected by a larger surface than that provided by my mind during all the years from my </text>
<text top="362" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">childhood to the time of the ecstatic vision. The area of my peripheral consciousness had undeniably increased, for I </text>
<text top="376" left="9" width="394" height="13" font="5">could not be mistaken about a fact continually in front of me during waking hours.</text>
<text top="402" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">The phenomenon was so strange and so out of the ordinary that I felt convinced that it would be useless on my part to </text>
<text top="416" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">look for a parallel case, even if the weird transformation was because of the action of an awakened Kundalini and not a </text>
<text top="430" left="9" width="547" height="13" font="5">unique abnormality affecting me only. Realising also the futility of revealing this entirely out-of-the-common and </text>
<text top="444" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">unheard-of development to others, I kept my secret strictly to myself, saying nothing of it even to those most intimately </text>
<text top="458" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">connected with me. As my physical and mental condition gave me no cause for uneasiness in any respect, except for this</text>
<text top="472" left="9" width="332" height="13" font="5">inexplicable peculiarity, I gradually ceased to trouble myself about it.</text>
<text top="497" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">As already mentioned in an earlier chapter, in the initial stages of my experience it appeared as if I were viewing the </text>
<text top="511" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">world through a mental haze, or to be more clear, as if a thin layer of extremely fine dust hung between me and the </text>
<text top="525" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">objects perceived. It was not an optical defect, as my eyesight was as sharp as ever and the haze seemed to envelop not </text>
<text top="539" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">the sensual but the perceptive organ. The dust was on the conscious mirror which reflected the image of the objects. It </text>
<text top="553" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">seemed as if the objects seen were being viewed through a whitish medium, which made them look as if an extremely </text>
<text top="567" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">fine and uniform coat of chalk dust were laid on them without in the least blurring the outline or the normal colour </text>
<text top="581" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">peculiar to each. The coat hung between me and the sky, the branches and leaves of trees, the green grass, the houses, </text>
<text top="595" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">the paved streets, the dress and faces of men, lending to all a chalky appearance, precisely as if the conscious -centre in </text>
<text top="609" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">me, which interpreted sensory impressions, were now operating through a white medium, needing further refinement </text>
<text top="623" left="9" width="216" height="13" font="5">and cleaning to make it perfectly transparent.</text>
<text top="649" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">As in the case of enlargement of the visual image, I was entirely at a loss to assign a satisfactory reason for this whitish </text>
<text top="663" left="9" width="512" height="13" font="5">appearance of the objects perceived. Any change of time, place, or weather had absolutely no effect on the </text>
<text top="677" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">transformation. It was as apparent under lamplight as in the sun, as noticeable in the clear light of morning as at dusk. </text>
<text top="691" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">Obviously the change was internal and not subject to alteration by changed external influences. Surprised, yet mute, I </text>
<text top="705" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">continued to pass my days and nights at Jammu attending to my duties and minding my tasks as others were doing. The </text>
<text top="719" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">only plausible reason for this change in my cognitive faculty which I could think of was that the animating principle </text>
<text top="733" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">inhabiting the body was now operating the mechanism through an altered vital medium. This led to an alteration in the </text>
<text top="747" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">quality and behaviour of the nerve currents regulating the functions of the organs as well as in the quality of the sensory </text>
<text top="760" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">impressions and their interpretations by the observing mind. But all that had happened and was still happening was so </text>
<text top="774" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">unprecedented and incredible that I felt easier in mind in treating it all as an abnormality rather than as a natural growth </text>
<text top="788" left="9" width="365" height="13" font="5">governed by regular biological laws which ultimately it indeed proved to be.</text>
<text top="814" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">In this manner a prey to doubts and uneasiness I continued to pass my time until one sunny day, when on my way to the </text>

<text top="3" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">office, I happened to look at the front block of the Rajgarh Palace, in which the Government offices were located, taking</text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">in my glance the sky as well as the roof and the upper part of the building. I looked casually at first, then struck by </text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">something strange in their appearance, more attentively, unable to withdraw my gaze, and finally rooted to the spot I </text>
<text top="45" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">stared in amazement at the spectacle, unable to believe the testimony of my eyes. I was looking at a scene familiar to me</text>
<text top="59" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">in one way before the experience and in another during the last few months, but what I now saw was so extraordinary as</text>
<text top="73" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">to render me motionless with surprise. I was looking at a scene belonging not to the earth but to some fairyland, for the </text>
<text top="87" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">ancient, weather-stained front of the building, unadorned and commonplace, and the arch of sky above it, bathed in the </text>
<text top="101" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">clear light of the sun, were both lit with a brilliant silvery lustre that lent a beauty and a glory to both and created a </text>
<text top="115" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">marvellous light and shade effect impossible to describe. Wonderstruck, I turned my eyes in other directions, fascinated </text>
<text top="129" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">by the silvery shine which glorified everything. Clearly I was witnessing a new phase in my development; the lustre </text>
<text top="143" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">which I perceived on every side and in all objects did not emanate from them but was undoubtedly a projection of my </text>
<text top="157" left="9" width="106" height="13" font="5">own internal radiance.</text>
<text top="222" left="9" width="111" height="20" font="3">Chapter Eleven</text>
<text top="255" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">ENTIRELY absorbed in the contemplation of the enchanting view, I lost all touch with my surroundings, completely </text>
<text top="269" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">forgetting that I was standing like a statue in the middle of a road thronged at that time of day with crowds of employees</text>
<text top="283" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">going to the Secretariat. Collecting my thoughts, like one suddenly awakened from a beatific vision, I looked around, </text>
<text top="297" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">withdrawing my glance with difficulty from the delightful scene. Many pairs of eyes from the rapidly moving crowd on </text>
<text top="311" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">every side looked at me in surprise, unable to account for my abrupt halt and subsequent immobility. Pulling myself </text>
<text top="325" left="9" width="538" height="13" font="5">together, I walked leisurely in the direction of the office, keeping my eyes on the building and the portion of the </text>
<text top="339" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">overhanging sky in front of me. Completely unprepared for such a development, I could not bring myself to believe that </text>
<text top="353" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">what I was gazing at was real and not a vision conjured up by my fancy stimulated to greater activity by the intriguing </text>
<text top="367" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">aureole, perceptible to me always around my head. I looked intently in front and around again and again, rubbing my </text>
<text top="381" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">eyes to assure myself that I was not dreaming. No, I was surely in the centre of the Secretariat quadrangle, moving </text>
<text top="394" left="9" width="548" height="13" font="5">slowly in the midst of a bustling throng hastening in all directions, like them in all other respects except that I was </text>
<text top="408" left="9" width="208" height="13" font="5">looking at the world with a different vision.</text>
<text top="434" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">On entering my room, instead of sitting at my desk I walked out on to the verandah at the back, where it was my habit to</text>
<text top="448" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">pass some time daily for a breath of fresh air while looking at the fine view open in front. There was a row of houses </text>
<text top="462" left="9" width="539" height="13" font="5">before me edged by a steep woody slope leading to the bank of the Tawi river, whose wide boulder-covered bed </text>
<text top="476" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">glistened in the sun with a thin stream of water running in the middle, bordered on the other side by another hillock with</text>
<text top="490" left="9" width="578" height="13" font="5">a small medieval fortress on top. I had looked at the same sight almost daily in winter for several years and the picture of</text>
<text top="504" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">it was vividly present in my memory. During the past few months, when gazing at it, I found that it too had assumed </text>
<text top="518" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">grander proportions and had the same chalky appearance I had noticed in all other objects. On that memorable day when</text>
<text top="532" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">my eyes swept across the river bed to the hillock and from there to the sky, trying to take the whole panorama in one </text>
<text top="546" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">glance to make a comparison between what I was accustomed to see previously and what I perceived now, I was utterly </text>
<text top="560" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">amazed at the remarkable transformation. The magnified dimensions of the picture and the slightly chalky appearance of</text>
<text top="574" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">the objects were both present, but the dusty haze before my eyes had vanished and instead I was gazing fascinatedly at </text>
<text top="588" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">an extraordinarily rich blend of colour and shade, shining with a silvery lustre which lent an indescribable beauty to the </text>
<text top="602" left="9" width="30" height="13" font="5">scene.</text>
<text top="628" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">Breathless with excitement, I turned my eyes in all directions, viewing each object attentively, eager to find whether the </text>
<text top="642" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">transformation was noticeable in all or whether it was an illusion caused by the particularly clear and sunny weather on </text>
<text top="656" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">that day. I looked and looked, allowing my gaze to linger for some time on each spot, convinced more firmly after each </text>
<text top="669" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">intent glance that far from being the victim of an optical illusion, I was seeing a brightly coloured real scene before me, </text>
<text top="683" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">shining with a milky lustre never before perceived. A surge of emotion too deep for words filled my whole being, and </text>
<text top="697" left="9" width="530" height="13" font="5">tears gathered in my eyes in spite of myself at the significance of the new development in me. But even in that </text>
<text top="711" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">condition, looking through tears, I could perceive trembling beams of silvery light dancing before my vision, enhancing </text>
<text top="725" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">the radiant beauty of the scene. It was not difficult to understand that, without my being aware of it, an extraordinary </text>
<text top="739" left="9" width="538" height="13" font="5">change had taken place in the now luminous cognitive centre in my brain and that the fascinating lustre, which I </text>
<text top="753" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">perceived around every object, was not a figment of my fancy nor was it possessed by the objects, but a projection of </text>
<text top="767" left="9" width="125" height="13" font="5">my own internal radiance.</text>
<text top="793" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">Days and weeks passed without alteration in the lustrous form of sight. A bright silvery sheen around every object, </text>
<text top="807" left="9" width="544" height="13" font="5">across the entire field of vision, became a permanent feature of my being. The azure dome of the sky, whenever I </text>
<text top="821" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">happened to glance at it had a purity of colour and a brightness impossible to describe. If I had possessed the same form </text>

<page number="51" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="842" width="595">
<text top="3" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">of sight from my earliest childhood I should not have found anything striking in it, treating it as the usual endowment of </text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="543" height="13" font="5">every normal man, but the alteration from the previous to the present state was so obvious, so remarkable, and so </text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">fascinating that I could not but be immensely moved and surprised by it. Examining myself closely for any other change</text>
<text top="45" left="9" width="545" height="13" font="5">in my sensual perceptions, I became conscious of the fact that there had occurred an amplification and refining of </text>
<text top="59" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">auditory sensations also, as a result of which the sounds heard possessed now an exotic quality and a distinctiveness that</text>
<text top="73" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">lent to music and melody a greater sweetness and to noise and clamour a more disagreeable harshness. The alteration </text>
<text top="87" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">was not, however, so marked and striking as the change in visual impressions until a few years later. The olfactory, </text>
<text top="101" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">gustatory, and tactile centres as well exhibited a peculiar sensitivity and acuteness, clearly perceptible, but in point of </text>
<text top="115" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">magnitude nothing compared to what had happened with my sight. The phenomenon was observable during darkness, </text>
<text top="129" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">too. At night lamps glowed with a new brilliance while illuminated objects glistened with a peculiar lustre not wholly </text>
<text top="143" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">borrowed from the lamps. In the course of a few weeks, the transformation ceased to cause me wonder or excitement, </text>
<text top="157" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">and gradually I came to treat it as an inseparable part of myself, a normal characteristic of my being. Wherever I went </text>
<text top="171" left="9" width="540" height="13" font="5">and whatever I did, I was conscious of myself in the new form, cognizant of the radiance within and the lustrous </text>
<text top="185" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">objectivity without. I was changing. The old self was yielding place to a new personality endowed with a brighter, more </text>
<text top="199" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">refined and artistic perceptive equipment, developed from the original one by a strange process of cellular and organic </text>
<text top="212" left="9" width="73" height="13" font="5">transformation.</text>
<text top="238" left="9" width="547" height="13" font="5">Towards the middle of April that year, before leaving for Srinagar, I went to Hardwar with the sacred relics of my </text>
<text top="252" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">departed mother whom, to my sorrow, I had lost during the year preceding the experience. I had been to Hardwar once </text>
<text top="266" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">before on a similar errand after the death of my father. On this occasion all through the journey by rail and during the </text>
<text top="280" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">few days of my stay at Hardwar I was constantly reminded of the marvellous change in me. I travelled by the same </text>
<text top="294" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">route, saw the same stations, towns and sights, until I reached my destination and there also the same quaint streets and </text>
<text top="308" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">buildings, the same Ganges with its swiftly flowing sapphire water, the same bathing places and ghats thronged with </text>
<text top="322" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">pilgrims. They were all as I had seen them last but how different was the picture perceived by me on this occasion; </text>
<text top="336" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">every object now formed a part of a greatly extended field of vision in striking contrast to the previous one, the whole </text>
<text top="350" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">assemblage lit with a glitter like that of freshly fallen snow when the sun shines upon it. After performing the sacred </text>
<text top="364" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">rites, I returned to Jammu, refreshed by the change, more firmly convinced about the new development in me. Soon </text>
<text top="378" left="9" width="228" height="13" font="5">after, I left for Srinagar with my office as usual.</text>
<text top="404" left="9" width="547" height="13" font="5">Years passed. My health and vitality were completely restored. I could read continuously for long periods without </text>
<text top="418" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">fatigue and even indulge in my favourite pastime, chess, demanding close attention for hours. The diet became normal </text>
<text top="432" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">and the only article to remind me of my experience was a cup of milk in the morning and another in the afternoon with a</text>
<text top="446" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">slice of bread. I could not, however, stand a fast with impunity, but if obliged to keep one was not seriously affected by </text>
<text top="460" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">it either. In spite of all these signs of normality, it was easy to perceive that mentally I was not the same old self. The </text>
<text top="474" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">lustre within and without became more and more perceptible with the passage of time. With my inner vision I could </text>
<text top="487" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">distinctly perceive the flow of lucent currents of vital energy through the network of nerves in my body. A living silvery</text>
<text top="501" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">flame with a delicate golden tinge was clearly perceptible in the interior of my brain across the forehead. My thought </text>
<text top="515" left="9" width="544" height="13" font="5">images were vividly bright, and every object recalled to memory possessed radiance in the same manner as in the </text>
<text top="529" left="9" width="70" height="13" font="5">concrete form.</text>
<text top="555" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">My reaction to infection and disease was not, however, normal. In every illness the characteristic symptoms of the </text>
<text top="569" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">ailment, though present, were distinctly milder in nature and usually there was an absence of temperature. The rapidity </text>
<text top="583" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">of the pulse was the main indication of the indisposition, but it was seldom, if ever, accompanied by a corresponding </text>
<text top="597" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">rise in the heat of the body as normally occurs with disease. This peculiarity is as observable now as it was in those </text>
<text top="611" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">days. The only explanation for it that I can think of is that my highly nervous organism does not permit the flow of </text>
<text top="625" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">heated blood to the brain as a measure of safety to avoid injury to the now exceptionally sensitive cerebral matter, and </text>
<text top="639" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">adopts other devices to free the body from infection. I could not stand medication during illness or fasting and invariably</text>
<text top="653" left="9" width="191" height="13" font="5">resorted to dietetic remedies to get well.</text>
<text top="679" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">I have said a good deal about the working of my mental equipment during waking hours without making any mention </text>
<text top="693" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">about its condition during sleep. The first time I became aware of an alteration in my dream consciousness was during </text>
<text top="707" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">the night in February 1938 when I passed the crisis, tasting sleep after several weeks of insomnia accompanied by a </text>
<text top="721" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">maddening mental condition. I fell asleep that night wrapped in a mantle of light perceptible in the dreams also. From </text>
<text top="735" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">that day extraordinarily vivid dreams became habitual with me. The bright lustre in my head, always present during </text>
<text top="749" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">wakefulness, continued undiminished during sleep; if anything, more clearly apparent and more active during the night </text>
<text top="762" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">than during the day. The moment I rested my head on the pillow and closed my eyes to invite sleep, the first object to </text>
<text top="776" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">draw my attention was the cranial glow, clearly distinguishable in darkness, not stationary and steady but spreading out </text>
<text top="790" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">and narrowing down like a whirlpool or swirling water in the sun. In the beginning and for many months it appeared as </text>
<text top="804" left="9" width="547" height="13" font="5">if a piston, working in the spinal tube at the bottom, were throwing up stream after stream of a very lustrous fluid, </text>
<text top="818" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">impalpable but distinctly visible, with such force that I actually felt my whole body shaking with the impact of the </text>
</page>
<page number="52" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="842" width="595">
<text top="3" left="9" width="269" height="13" font="5">current to such an extent as made the bed creak at times.</text>
<text top="29" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">The dreams were wonderful, and always occurred against a shining background formed by the widespread luminous </text>
<text top="43" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">glow inside, which lent a strange phosphorescence to the dream images also. Every night during sleep I was transported </text>
<text top="57" left="9" width="547" height="13" font="5">to a glittering fairyland, where garbed in lustre I glided from place to place, light as a feather. Scene after scene of </text>
<text top="71" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">inexpressible glory unfolded before my vision. The incidents were of the usual character common to dreams. They often</text>
<text top="85" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">lacked coherence and continuity, but although strange, fanciful and fantastic, they possessed a visionary character, </text>
<text top="99" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">surrounded by landscapes of a vastness and magnificence seldom seen in real life. In my dreams I usually experienced a </text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">feeling of security and contentment with the absence of anything in the least disturbing or disharmonious, all blended </text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">into a sense of peace and happiness, which gave my dream personality a character so unique and alluring that I never </text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">missed having ten hours of rest and when distraught or dismayed during the day invariably sought the sanctuary of sleep</text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">to rid myself of worry and fear. I had never dreamt such vivid dreams before. They naturally followed the pattern of my </text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">new personality, and were woven of the same luminous stuff which formed the texture of my daytime thoughts and </text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">fancies. It was clear beyond a doubt that light not only pervaded my peripheral consciousness but had penetrated deep </text>
<text top="197" left="9" width="245" height="13" font="5">into the recesses of my subconscious being as well.</text>
<text top="222" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">In course of time the idea began to take root in my mind that the enhanced activity of the radiant current during sleep </text>
<text top="236" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">was an indication of the fact that in some incomprehensible way the opportunity afforded by the passive state of the </text>
<text top="250" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">brain was being utilized for immunizing it and the complicated nerve structures to the action of the newly released </text>
<text top="264" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">dynamic force in place of the former less potent vital energy. But for years I was unable to guess what was happening </text>
<text top="278" left="9" width="537" height="13" font="5">inside me. I had come across vague statements in some of the ancient writings on Kundalini Yoga hinting at the </text>
<text top="292" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">transformative power of the divine energy. The hints were so obscure and so lacking in detail that I could not grasp how </text>
<text top="306" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">the human organism with an unalterable legacy of numberless hereditary factors stretching back for millions of years by </text>
<text top="320" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">which it is moulded into a certain shape, possessing a certain strictly circumscribed brain power and intelligence, could </text>
<text top="334" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">be rebuilt from within to a far different or higher type of cerebral activity, enabling it to transcend the limits prescribed </text>
<text top="348" left="9" width="535" height="13" font="5">by nature for it from birth. Taking into account the organic changes involved in a process of this kind, affecting </text>
<text top="362" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">simultaneously all constituents of the body and also the extremely delicate tissues of the brain and nervous system, the </text>
<text top="376" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">task of transformation envisaged in its true significance assumes such colossal proportions as to make it appear almost </text>
<text top="390" left="9" width="159" height="13" font="5">beyond the bounds of possibility.</text>
<text top="416" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">But something wholly inexplicable was transpiring inside my body frame, particularly during the long period devoted to</text>
<text top="430" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">sleep, when my inactive will was powerless to cause any interference in the new immensely accelerated anabolic and </text>
<text top="444" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">catabolic processes in the body. That my whole system was functioning in an altered manner, forced to a far higher pitch</text>
<text top="458" left="9" width="521" height="13" font="5">of metabolic activity under the compulsion of the lustrous, vital, energy racing through my nerves, I realized </text>
<text top="472" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">immediately after the crisis. It was impossible to mistake the increase in the pulse rate and the greater activity of the </text>
<text top="485" left="9" width="533" height="13" font="5">heart during the first part of the night as well as the sudden undeniable alteration in my digestive and excretory </text>
<text top="499" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">functions. I could not disbelieve the testimony of my own senses for months and years and the evidence of those who </text>
<text top="513" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">surrounded and looked after me, nor can I mistrust the proof furnished by my senses now, as the apparently abnormal </text>
<text top="527" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">metabolic activity which started more than twenty-five years ago continues undiminished to this hour and, from all </text>
<text top="541" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">indications, will continue to the end. It is not necessary for me to array proofs in support of the startling disclosure I am </text>
<text top="555" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">making. That would make this work too lengthy and specialized. But any trained observer who has the least knowledge </text>
<text top="569" left="9" width="455" height="13" font="5">of physiology can convince himself of the fact in a day after kindling the sacred fire in himself.</text>
<text top="595" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">The plan of this work does not permit me to describe in detail the constantly occurring physiological reactions and </text>
<text top="609" left="9" width="538" height="13" font="5">changes to which I was a daily witness, convincing me beyond doubt that my body was undergoing a process of </text>
<text top="623" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">purgation and rejuvenation side by side with some definite purpose entirely beyond my grasp. Otherwise there could be </text>
<text top="637" left="9" width="544" height="13" font="5">no other reasonable explanation for the feverish and sometimes even frantic activity continuously going on in my </text>
<text top="651" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">interior day and night, except that the organism as a whole was reacting to a new situation created inside by an altered </text>
<text top="665" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">activity of the vital organs, as happens in all pathological conditions to adjust itself to the changed environment within. </text>
<text top="679" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">Undoubtedly the disorder in my body was caused by the rapid passage of the luminous vital energy from cell to cell.</text>
<text top="705" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">Under the action of a stronger current than that for which it was designed, any man-made mechanism, even a hundredth </text>
<text top="719" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">part as sensitive and intricate as the human frame is, would be wrecked or damaged immediately, but because of certain </text>
<text top="733" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">inherent qualities, developed by the human organism as a means of evolution, the sudden release of the serpent power, </text>
<text top="747" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">provided the blood is healthy and the organs sound, is not attended by fatal results in favourable cases because of safety </text>
<text top="760" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">devices already provided by nature to meet a contingency of this kind in individuals ready for the experience. Even in </text>
<text top="774" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">such cases it is essential that the energy be benignly disposed and that the subject take the necessary precautions to </text>
<text top="788" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">maintain the strength of the body and the balance of the mind during the subsequent period of inexpressibly severe trial. </text>
<text top="802" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">How far I was endowed with a constitution suited for the great ordeal I cannot say, but being an utter stranger to the </text>
<text top="816" left="9" width="541" height="13" font="5">science, taken unawares without the requisite preliminary course of physical and mental discipline, and a prey to </text>
</page>
<page number="53" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="842" width="595">
<text top="3" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">adversity, I was buffeted unceasingly for many years partly because of my ignorance and lack of sufficient strength and </text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="424" height="13" font="5">partly because of the extreme suddenness and rapidity of the extraordinary development.</text>
<text top="43" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">After the first most distressing period of trial I found in sleep the supreme healer for my physical and mental suffering </text>
<text top="57" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">during the day. There were unmistakable indications of abnormal activity in the region of Kundalini from the moment of</text>
<text top="71" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">my retiring to sleep until the morning. It was obvious that by some mysterious process the precious secretion of the </text>
<text top="85" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">seminal glands was drawn up into the spinal tube and through the interlinking nerves transferred into a subtle essence, </text>
<text top="99" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">then distributed to the brain and the vital organs, darting across the nerve filaments and the spinal cord to reach them. </text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">The suction was applied with such vigour as to be clearly apparent, and sometimes in the early stages with such violence</text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">as to cause actual pain to the delicate parts. At such times the ferment caused in the body resembled in effect the last </text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">minute frantic effort made for succour when a life is in imminent danger, and I, a dumb and helpless witness to the </text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">show, could not help but pass hours of agony thinking of this abnormal development in myself. It was easy to see that </text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">the aim of this entirely new and unexpected activity was to divert the seminal essence to the head and other vital organs, </text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="546" height="13" font="5">after sublimation, apparently to meet a contingency caused by a sudden disorder in any organ or a general discord </text>
<text top="197" left="9" width="160" height="13" font="5">inimical to the new development.</text>
<text top="222" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">With the power of observation left to me even in the initial distraught condition of the mind, I could not fail to take </text>
<text top="236" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">notice of such a startling development in the sexual region functioning quite normally until that time. I could not fail to </text>
<text top="250" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">mark the agitated condition of the hitherto quiescent area now in a state of feverish activity and ceaseless movement as </text>
<text top="264" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">if forced by an invisible but effective mechanism, not in operation before, to produce the life fluid in superabundance </text>
<text top="278" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">without cessation, in order to meet the unending demand of the cerebral lobes and the nervous system. After only a few </text>
<text top="292" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">days of observation of this unmistakable organic phenomenon the idea dawned on me that I had unwittingly forced open</text>
<text top="306" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">a yet imperfectly developed centre in the brain by the long-continued practice of concentration, and that the abnormal </text>
<text top="320" left="9" width="547" height="13" font="5">and apparently chaotic play of vital currents which I clearly felt was a natural effort of the organism to control the </text>
<text top="334" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">serious situation thus created. It was also apparent that in this grave emergency the body was making abundant use of </text>
<text top="348" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">the richest and most potent source of life energy in it, the vital essence, always available in the region commanded by </text>
<text top="362" left="9" width="51" height="13" font="5">Kundalini.</text>
<text top="388" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">I make but a simple statement of fact when I say that for years I was like one bound hand and foot to a log racing madly </text>
<text top="402" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">on a torrent, saved miraculously time after time from dashing to death against the many boulders projecting out of the </text>
<text top="416" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">swirling water on every side by just a narrow margin and in the nick of time, turning and twisting this way and that, as if</text>
<text top="430" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">guided by a marvellously quick and dexterous hand, infallibly correct in its movement. Often at night for years, when </text>
<text top="444" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">lying awake in bed waiting for sleep to come, I felt the powerful new life energy sweep like a tempest in the abdominal </text>
<text top="458" left="9" width="542" height="13" font="5">and thoracic regions as well as the brain with a roaring noise in the ears, a scintillating shower in the brain, and a </text>
<text top="472" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">feverish movement in the sexual region and its neighbourhood around the base of the spine, both in front and behind, as </text>
<text top="485" left="9" width="541" height="13" font="5">if an all-out effort were being made to fight an emergency caused by some poison or obstruction in the organism </text>
<text top="499" left="9" width="442" height="13" font="5">threatening the supersensitive and extremely delicate condition of the cerebro-spinal system.</text>
<text top="525" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">At such times I felt instinctively that a life and death struggle was going on inside me in which I, the owner of the body, </text>
<text top="539" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">was entirely powerless to take part, forced to lie quietly and watch as a spectator the weird drama unfolded in my own </text>
<text top="553" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">flesh. Nothing can convey my condition more graphically than the representation of Shiva and Shakti, pictured by an </text>
<text top="567" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">ancient master, in which the former is shown lying helpless and supine while the latter in an absolutely reckless mood </text>
<text top="581" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">dances gleefully on his prostrate frame. The self-conscious observer in me, the self-styled possessor of the carnal frame, </text>
<text top="595" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">now completely subjugated and pushed into the background, found himself utterly at the mercy, literally under the feet, </text>
<text top="609" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">of an awe-inspiring power indifferent to what he thought and felt, proceeding impassively to deal with the body as it </text>
<text top="623" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">chose without even conceding to him the right to know what he had done to merit the indignity. I had every reason to </text>
<text top="637" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">believe the representation was designed to depict a condition exactly similar to mine by an initiate who had himself </text>
<text top="651" left="9" width="153" height="13" font="5">passed through the same ordeal.</text>
<text top="677" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">The utter helplessness of the devotee and his entire dependence on the mercy and grace of the cosmic vital energy, </text>
<text top="691" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">Shakti, when Kundalini is aroused, is the constant theme of hymns addressed to the goddess by eminent yogis of yore. </text>
<text top="705" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">As the supreme mistress of the body, she and she alone is considered to be competent to bestow on earnest aspirants </text>

<text top="115" left="9" width="547" height="13" font="5">After the experience had calmed and his life returned to regularity, our author notes two remaining difficulties: he </text>
<text top="129" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">cannot read attentively for longer periods and he 'continued to have a fear of the supernatural'. In Chapter Ten he takes </text>
<text top="143" left="9" width="123" height="13" font="5">up this religious problem.</text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="525" height="13" font="5">From the narrowly psycho-dynamic view, this <i>fear of the supernatural </i>is the result of repression. Anxiety is a</text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">manifestation in consciousness of a fear of a return of the repressed, in this case, of the unconscious itself. But, beyond</text>
<text top="197" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">this, we may also say that fear is the appropriate reaction after any trauma—the burnt child fears the fire. That this fear</text>
<text top="211" left="9" width="526" height="13" font="5">focused especially on the supernatural implies a new awareness of the unconscious, a new relation to it, a new</text>
<text top="225" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">orientation of consciousness towards whatever lies outside its ken. As modern readers we can identify with our author.</text>
<text top="239" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">Until his experience, and even in spite of a deeply religious attitude, our author was not afraid of the Gods or of the</text>
<text top="253" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">other world. He longed for it and worked daily to reach it. His religious attitude was comparable to the Western man's</text>
<text top="267" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">collective church-going belief. But now, having had a taste of this other world, he is in fear and trembling of anything</text>
<text top="281" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">which has to do with it. More, he is enraged by the usual sort of faith (people coming from places of worship, the usual</text>
<text top="295" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">pious literature, etc.). He finds himself 'devoid completely of every religious sentiment', and cannot understand this</text>
<text top="309" left="9" width="371" height="13" font="5">'alteration in the very depths of my personality'. He is in a God-is-dead phase.</text>
<text top="335" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">From the experience one gathers through working with Western practitioners of organized religion this turn of events is</text>
<text top="349" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">not unusual. A true face-to-face encounter with the numinous shatters all previous religious ideas. Sometimes analysis</text>
<text top="363" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">releases a genuine religious experience, and when it occurs in a clergyman, it seems to conflict with rather than support</text>
<text top="376" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">his previous training and system of beliefs. This is an astonishing state of affairs. Orthodoxy has always recognized this</text>
<text top="390" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">possibility and therefore warned dogmatically against individual experiences through visions and dreams. The mystic is</text>
<text top="404" left="9" width="541" height="13" font="5">not welcomed within the councils of collective religion, and one of the first acts of Jesus (cleansing the temple of</text>
<text top="418" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">money-changers) was performed in rage. Moses is moved by rage to smash the holy tablets, and the prophets—from the</text>
<text top="432" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">collective viewpoint—could also have been called 'devoid completely of every religious sentiment... rank atheists...</text>
<text top="446" left="9" width="534" height="13" font="5">violent heretics...'. Again, we have the psychological phenomenon that the greatest danger is not the opposite or</text>
<text top="460" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">contradiction of truth, but its nearest imitation. Pink sentimental religion threatens the real red thing more than does any</text>
<text top="474" left="9" width="48" height="13" font="5">antithesis.</text>
<text top="500" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">The <i>alteration of his religious attitude </i>and his fear of the supernatural brought home to our author two lessons. First, a </text>
<text top="514" left="9" width="544" height="13" font="5">new appreciation of the values in this world (family, feeling connections, work and colleagues, health, the simple </text>
<text top="528" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">things); second, that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. In other words, the fear of the supernatural has </text>
<text top="542" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">made him aware of his own natural limits. The other world has become terrifyingly, experientially real; he has felt its </text>
<text top="556" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">power, not just known of it from books and teachings. He becomes the <i>'homo religiosus' </i>through the very fear itself, </text>
<text top="570" left="9" width="298" height="13" font="5">which is nothing else than awe, the primary religious emotion.</text>
<text top="596" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">Now he can say that the movement to the other world is not a one-step matter. It is not crossing a threshold from a </text>
<text top="610" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">smaller room to a larger just like that. This is an old debate in spiritual disciplines. Is enlightenment achieved step by </text>
<text top="624" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">step as a pilgrim climbs that mountain? Or is it achieved in a break-through flash of illumination? According to the </text>
<text top="638" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">proponents of the second view, the first is impossible since we cannot achieve the eternal through a process in time. </text>
<text top="652" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">Gopi Krishna's observation that crossing the threshold is not done in one step implies that he however inclines to the </text>
<text top="665" left="9" width="256" height="13" font="5">first view, that enlightenment has a process character.</text>
<text top="691" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">Our text next describes the first major transformation: <i>the extension of consciousness. </i>This was first experienced as a </text>
<text top="705" left="9" width="540" height="13" font="5">halo or luminous circle around the head, at the beginning dusty, later cleared. Onians in his <i>Origins of European </i></text>
<text top="719" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="6"><i>Thought </i>explains how the early idea of one's daimon or genius was imaged as a radiation around the head, and that seers</text>
<text top="733" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">could of course perceive this in another person. The Saint is painted with a halo, implying that sanctity has something to</text>
<text top="747" left="9" width="234" height="13" font="5">do with illumination, with altered consciousness.</text>
<text top="773" left="9" width="543" height="13" font="5">He gives a clear account of this alteration. Consciousness and the 'I' are no longer identified. The ego 'instead of a</text>
<text top="787" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">confining unit, now itself encompassed by a shining conscious globe of vast dimensions'. He struggles with formulation,</text>
<text top="801" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">simile, metaphor— a common difficulty in the description of this phenomenon, since the formulator (the ego) cannot</text>
<text top="815" left="9" width="526" height="13" font="5">grasp the totality of the event. In a nutshell, 'There was ego consciousness as well as a vastly extended field of</text>
</page>
<page number="55" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="842" width="595">
<text top="3" left="9" width="258" height="13" font="5">awareness, existing side by side, both distinct yet one.</text>
<text top="29" left="9" width="539" height="13" font="5">This formulation is valuable for modern depth psychology. In our therapeutic work we aim at ego-development, </text>
<text top="43" left="9" width="548" height="13" font="5">assuming that the development of ego and the development of consciousness are one and the same thing. Jung has </text>
<text top="57" left="9" width="538" height="13" font="5">shown that the ultimate development of the ego is its submission to, even immersion in, a field of wider psychic </text>
<text top="71" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">consciousness with many archetypal foci, much as Gopi Krishna describes the 'I' as immersed in the pool of light 'yet </text>
<text top="85" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">fully cognizant of the ... volume of consciousness all around ...'. The problem in modern depth psychology is: how do </text>
<text top="99" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">we combine the idea of ego extension and development with the idea of extended and developed awareness? I mean by </text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="511" height="13" font="5">this: the two, ego and consciousness, are not the same; can they be developed independently of each other?</text>
<text top="139" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">I think we come upon a main difference between Jungian analysis and all other forms of psychotherapy and also we </text>
<text top="153" left="9" width="545" height="13" font="5">come upon a major similarity between Jungian analysis and Eastern disciplines. An aim of individuation-oriented </text>
<text top="167" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">analysis is the development of consciousness. In this process the ego plays only one of the roles, since the consciousness</text>
<text top="181" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">of other archetypal components (anima/animus, shadow, mother and father imagos, and the self) is also an aim of the </text>
<text top="195" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">work. In contradistinction to other systems of therapy Jungian analysis may result in the extension of consciousness </text>
<text top="208" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">without any of the usual visible signs of ego-development. The balance is delicate indeed: too little ego and there is no </text>
<text top="222" left="9" width="580" height="13" font="5">observer, no central point; too little consciousness apart from ego and there is too little objective field of awareness apart </text>
<text top="236" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">from subjectivity, too little impersonal sensitivity and compassion. For Western analysts the distinction between ego and</text>
<text top="250" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">consciousness means a re-thinking of our therapeutic aims, especially those aims of contemporary 'ego-psychology'.</text>
<text top="276" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">Alchemy gives us help in understanding the <i>whitening. </i>The 'silvery lustre', 'whitish medium', 'milky lustre', 'freshly </text>
<text top="290" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">fallen snow' are all terms we could as easily find in an alchemical text describing the wondrous appearance of the white </text>
<text top="304" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">phase. There, in alchemy, it occurs in the vessel and the language is chemical. They describe changes in which the </text>
<text top="318" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">substance so long worked over begins to whiten. (The earliest appearance of the white or anima phase, we may recall, </text>
<text top="332" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">came during the first burning fever reported in Chapter Four. There he catches sight of his small daughter, Ragina, lying</text>
<text top="346" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">in the next bed and considers himself through her eyes. He decides then not to treat himself from the outside [pouring </text>
<text top="360" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">cold water over his head] but to 'bear the internal agony' which then leads to the intuition of rousing the ida channel and </text>
<text top="374" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">cooling himself from within. It works. The fire gives way to a 'silvery streak' like the 'sinuous movement of a white </text>
<text top="388" left="9" width="286" height="13" font="5">serpent in rapid flight'. He then takes some milk and bread.)</text>
<text top="414" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">Psychologically this phase was prepared already by the shift from pingala to ida, that is, the change from a masculine to </text>
<text top="428" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">a feminine channel, the activation of the unconscious feminine side of the personality, or archetype of the anima. Gopi </text>
<text top="442" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">Krishna recognizes that the Kundalini is a feminine force and he uses the image of the lively vital Shakti standing over </text>
<text top="456" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">the prostrate Shiva (who, by the way, in many pictures is passive but for his open eyes and erected penis). The shift </text>
<text top="469" left="9" width="540" height="13" font="5">from pingala to ida which our author takes up only in a physiological way means psychologically that the Shakti </text>
<text top="483" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">feminine power cannot be made to serve the masculine principle. The Goddess is not activated to serve the man, but the </text>
<text top="497" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">feminine force or anima must have its own channel of activity, and man is only an instrument through which this force </text>
<text top="511" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">manifests itself. So, artists and writers put themselves at the disposal of the feminine muse, that white Goddess, who </text>
<text top="525" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">shows herself, when beneficent, in beauty, love, and inspiration. Through the Goddess, as when a man comes under her </text>
<text top="539" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">spell by falling in love (the most common of all experiences of the archetypal anima), things are 'seen in a new light', </text>
<text top="553" left="9" width="329" height="13" font="5">one's 'senses are sharpened' and the push of pingala seems irrelevant.</text>
<text top="579" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">The Kundalini as feminine force evidently required for our author a feminine channel, even if in some accounts of its </text>
<text top="593" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">rising it supposedly ascends through a central pathway, Sushumna. This feminine channel for the feminine force has a </text>
<text top="607" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">wide complex of meanings in Tantric thought just as it does in our notion of the anima archetype. Bharati <i>(The Tantric </i></text>
<text top="621" left="9" width="537" height="13" font="6"><i>Tradition, </i>pp. 175-7) collects various meanings of the left artery or ida channel. Curiously, we find one of these </text>
<text top="635" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">meanings is 'the digestive power' hinting that by religious attention to his food intake and digestion Gopi Krishna may </text>
<text top="649" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">also have been paying homage to the anima. This corresponds with our ideas of the anima as intimately connected with </text>
<text top="663" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">the neuro-vegetative system. According to Bharati's translations the female pole can mean 'wanton woman' as well as </text>
<text top="677" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">'nature' and 'intuitive wisdom', but also it can mean 'non-existence'. These aspects of the feminine are personified in </text>
<text top="691" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">Greek goddess figures where the not-being of Persephone is an essential part of her mother, nutritive nature, or Demeter,</text>
<text top="705" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">and where Aphrodite's wanton promiscuity finds place as does Athene's intuitive wisdom. This differentiation of the </text>
<text top="719" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">feminine is sorely lacking in our Judeo-Christian tradition which provides paltry examples of anima-consciousness, and </text>
<text top="733" left="9" width="172" height="13" font="5">these mainly secular and secondary.</text>
<text top="758" left="9" width="546" height="13" font="5">In psychological practice, the white phase refers to that period where a new feminine principle seems to dominate </text>
<text top="772" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">consciousness. There is more fantasy, the dreams are more vivid, there is less purposeful worldly action, there is more </text>
<text top="786" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">slowness, gentleness, even cool remoteness. The long period of intense suffering, depression, and worry (the nigredo) </text>
<text top="800" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">seems to slip away into a world of moonlight where everything seems redeemed and it is enough to have a sweet simple </text>
<text top="814" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">smile of peace and wisdom. One is more receptive, impressionable, sensitive. A new form of love comes to life, which </text>

<page number="56" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="842" width="595">
<text top="3" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">at first is still romantic and wrapped up with oneself. Above all, this white phase, once the regressive virginal aspects are</text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="428" height="13" font="5">recognized, offers the possibility of carrying the seeds for the future in patient pregnancy.</text>
<text top="43" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">Alchemy too gives parallels to the phenomenon of improved <i>health. </i>The white phase was one of the pre-forms of the </text>
<text top="57" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">final Stone and as such was a pre-form of the elixir of health. Although not immune, our author writes that diseases now</text>
<text top="71" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">were 'distinctly milder in nature and usually there was an absence of temperature'. The idea that the Goddess in one form</text>
<text top="85" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">or another gives and takes away disease is widespread in India. In the West some go to the shrines of Mary for cures. </text>
<text top="99" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">Implied is the idea that a developed relation to the anima, to the feminine principle, is an essential ingredient for health </text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">or wholeness. The feminine as such is said to be the principle of nature and life to which we can hardly relate adequately</text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">until we have integrated that feminine part of our own selves. Gopi Krishna makes this a central point of his work, </text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="326" height="13" font="5">recognizing from the first that the Kundalini is feminine, a Goddess.</text>
<text top="207" left="9" width="115" height="20" font="3">Chapter Twelve</text>
<text top="239" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">VIEWED in the light of the physiological reactions for which unmistakable evidence was furnished by my body every </text>
<text top="253" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">day, I had ample ground for the supposition that some kind of transformative process was at work in me, but I could not </text>
<text top="267" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">tell with what object. The most I could imagine was that I was gradually being led towards a condition of the brain and </text>
<text top="281" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">the nervous system which would make it possible for me to attain occasionally the state of extended consciousness </text>
<text top="295" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">peculiar to yogis and mystics in trance conditions. This did not mean that I had not an enlarged consciousness from the </text>
<text top="309" left="9" width="540" height="13" font="5">time of my first experience of Kundalini, which had caused me so much surprise and torture, and of which I was </text>
<text top="323" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">constantly reminded whenever my thoughts rested on myself; but the extension I had in mind was of a superior kind, </text>
<text top="337" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">signifying a complete negation of the ties that bind the spirit to the body, leaving it free to soar to superphysical heights </text>
<text top="351" left="9" width="281" height="13" font="5">and to return to the normal state refreshed and invigorated.</text>
<text top="376" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">This was my idea of supersensible experience, gleaned from the scriptures, the stories of spiritual men and their own </text>
<text top="390" left="9" width="537" height="13" font="5">accounts of the ecstatic condition. Barring the blissful vision of extended personality which I perceived twice in </text>
<text top="404" left="9" width="536" height="13" font="5">succession in the very beginning, there was certainly no comparison between my now undeniably extended and </text>
<text top="418" left="9" width="537" height="13" font="5">luminous self, as securely bound to the body and the earth, as readily affected by physical needs and as strongly </text>
<text top="432" left="9" width="527" height="13" font="5">influenced by desire and passion, heat and cold, pleasure and pain as the common one, and the exalted, full of </text>
<text top="446" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">happiness, free-from-fear, immune-from-pain, and indifferent-to-death super-consciousness of the ecstatic. I was the </text>
<text top="460" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">same being mentally as I had been before; a man of common clay far below, intellectually and morally, the spiritual </text>
<text top="474" left="9" width="145" height="13" font="5">giants about whom I had read.</text>
<text top="500" left="9" width="523" height="13" font="5">I missed no opportunity to study my symptoms critically and thoroughly. There was no other change save the</text>
<text top="514" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">unaccountable alteration in the nerve currents and the ever-present radiance inside and out. The lustrous visibility, which</text>
<text top="528" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">represented the latest phase in my strange development, had a heartening and uplifting effect upon me. This was indeed</text>
<text top="542" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">something that gave to my weird adventure a touch of sublimity. There could be no doubt now that I was undergoing a</text>
<text top="556" left="9" width="541" height="13" font="5">transformation, and although I had in no respect risen above the average, I had at least the consolation that in this</text>
<text top="570" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">particular I was nearer to the hallowed hierarchy than to the men of common calibre whom I resembled in every other</text>
<text top="584" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">way. But at the same time I could not shut my eyes to the glaring fact that the suffering I had undergone was out of all</text>
<text top="598" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">proportion to the results achieved, for which there was no explanation, save that either I had developed an abnormality</text>
<text top="612" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">or that the internal attempt at purification and transformation which began with the awakening had proved abortive in</text>
<text top="626" left="9" width="545" height="13" font="5">my case, and that consequently, perhaps as a result of inherent physical or mental deficiency, I had the unenviable</text>

<text top="679" left="9" width="535" height="13" font="5">As years passed and I perceived no other indication of spiritual unfolding, or the growth of a higher personality </text>

<text top="749" left="9" width="338" height="13" font="5">myself favoured, if not to the maximum, at least to a noticeable extent.</text>
<text top="775" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">Physically I became almost my old self again, hardy and tough, able to withstand hunger, the rigours of heat and cold, </text>

<text top="817" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">was made good by a longer period of rest during the day or night following the sleepless one. I felt on such occasions as </text>

<text top="3" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">if my brain had been deprived of its usual dose of energy which enabled it to maintain the extensive dimension to which </text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="215" height="13" font="5">it had now grown gradually during the years.</text>
<text top="43" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">But there was absolutely no diminution in the activity of the radiant vital currents during sleep. My dreams, which </text>
<text top="57" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">possessed a highly exotic and elusive quality, were so extraordinarily vivid and bright that in the dream condition I lived</text>
<text top="71" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">literally in a shining world in which every scene and every object glowed with lustre against a marvellously luminous </text>
<text top="85" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">background, the whole presenting a picture of such resplendence and sublime beauty that without implying the least </text>
<text top="99" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">exaggeration I actually felt as if every night during slumber I roamed in enchanting empyrean regions of heavenly life. </text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">The last thing I remembered on waking suddenly from sleep was usually a landscape or a figure enveloped in a bright </text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">blaze of light in such sharp contrast to the encircling gloom which met me on awakening that it seemed as if a celestial </text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="536" height="13" font="5">orb shining brilliantly in my interior was eclipsed all at once, leaving me to my fate in utter darkness. The vivid </text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">impressions left by a well-remembered happy dream during a night lingered for the whole day, a sweet memory of what </text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">appeared to be a supermundane existence of a few hours, to be followed by that of another seen on the succeeding night </text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="222" height="13" font="5">as sweet and vivid as that on the previous one.</text>
<text top="208" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">The magnificently brilliant effect present in the dreams was noticeable, though in a considerably diminished form, in the</text>
<text top="222" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">waking state also, but the sense of exaltation felt in the former was entirely absent. I distinctly experienced a partial </text>
<text top="236" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">eclipse of personality, a descent from a higher to a lower plane of being during the interval separating the dream state </text>
<text top="250" left="9" width="548" height="13" font="5">from wakefulness, and could clearly mark a narrowing down of the self, as if forced to shrink from a state of wide </text>
<text top="264" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">expansion to one of close confinement. There was undeniable evidence to show that the temporary transformation of </text>
<text top="278" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">personality apparent in the dreams was brought about by physiological processes which affected the whole organism, </text>
<text top="292" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">causing a heavy pressure on every part. During sleep my pulse rate was often considerably higher than during the day. I </text>
<text top="306" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">verified the fact frequently by putting my fingers to the pulse immediately on awakening at any time during the night. </text>
<text top="320" left="9" width="519" height="13" font="5">On numerous occasions I found it so rapid as to cause anxiety. The full and rapid beats clearly pointed to an </text>
<text top="334" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">undoubtedly accelerated metabolic process, to a quickly racing blood stream, to countless formations and alterations in </text>
<text top="348" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">cellular tissues, all affected by the vital current which swept like a storm through the entire organism with the obvious </text>
<text top="362" left="9" width="251" height="13" font="5">aim of refashioning it to a higher pitch of efficiency.</text>
<text top="388" left="9" width="532" height="13" font="5">Lack of sufficient knowledge of physiology made it difficult for the ancient adepts to correlate the psychic and </text>
<text top="402" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">physiological reactions caused by the activity of Kundalini. I laboured under the same disadvantage, but on account of </text>
<text top="416" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">the fact that a superficial knowledge of every branch of science is an easily acquired possession in these days of research</text>
<text top="430" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">and publicity, and that I had ample opportunity to study my condition day to day for many years, it became possible for </text>
<text top="444" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">me to observe critically the effects of the sudden development upon my system and to draw tentative inferences from it.</text>
<text top="469" left="9" width="544" height="13" font="5">I am irresistibly led to the conclusion that this extraordinary activity of the nervous system and brain is present in </text>
<text top="483" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">varying degrees in all cases of supernormal spiritual and psychic development, in a lesser measure in all cases of genius,</text>
<text top="497" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">in a still diminished form in all men of exceptionally high intellectual calibre, and in a morbid manner, when too violent </text>
<text top="511" left="9" width="513" height="13" font="5">and sudden or operative through a wrong nerve, in many kinds of insanity, neurosis, and other obscure and </text>
<text top="525" left="9" width="227" height="13" font="5">difficult-to-cure nervous and mental afflictions.</text>
<text top="551" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">Kundalini, as known to and described by the ancient authorities, signifies the development, sometimes spontaneous and </text>
<text top="565" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">less frequently through special psycho-physiological exercises, of extraordinary spiritual and mental powers associated </text>
<text top="579" left="9" width="540" height="13" font="5">with religion and the supernatural. There can be no doubt whatsoever that the incessant, easily perceptible, rapid </text>
<text top="593" left="9" width="535" height="13" font="5">movement at the base of my spine, affecting the nerves lining the whole area, was an indication of the fact that, </text>
<text top="607" left="9" width="509" height="13" font="5">controlled by an invisible mechanism, a hidden organ had begun to function all of a sudden in the hitherto </text>
<text top="621" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">innocent-looking region, converting the reproductive fluid into a radiant vital essence of high potency which, racing </text>
<text top="635" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">along the nerve fibres as well as the spinal canal, nourished the brain and the organs with a rejuvenating substance out of</text>
<text top="649" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">reach in any other way. For a long time I laboured under the belief that the glow in the head and the powerful nervous </text>
<text top="663" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">currents darting through my body were all occasioned by the sublimated seed, but as time wore on I was forced to alter </text>
<text top="677" left="9" width="517" height="13" font="5">my opinion. The activity in the reproductive region was not the only new development that had occurred. A </text>
<text top="691" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">corresponding change in the brain and other nerve centres had also taken place which regulated the consumption and </text>
<text top="705" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">output of the new mechanism. After the crisis the luminous currents did not move chaotically but with definite aim and </text>
<text top="719" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">purpose which was clearly evident from the fact that the whole organism overcame the initial resistance of recalcitrant </text>
<text top="733" left="9" width="373" height="13" font="5">and inferior parts and began gradually to adjust itself to the new development.</text>
<text top="758" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">On the strength of these and other facts I gradually came to the conclusion, which it shall rest with future investigators </text>
<text top="772" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">to confirm or disprove, that by virtue of the evolutionary processes still going on in the human body, a high-powered </text>

<text top="800" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">exceptionally sensitive brain tissue. The location of the centre allows it to command all parts of the brain and the entire </text>

<text top="31" left="9" width="540" height="13" font="5">evolved individuals is designed to function in place of the existing conscious centre, using for its activity a more </text>

<text top="87" left="9" width="539" height="13" font="5">current, the result is likely to be disastrous. The delicate tissues of the body in that case are likely to be damaged </text>
<text top="101" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">irreparably, causing strange maladies, insanity, or death. In a grave emergency of this kind the only way open to nature </text>
<text top="115" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">to avoid a catastrophe is to use liberally the ambrosia contained in the human seed and to rush it in a sublimated form to </text>
<text top="129" left="9" width="541" height="13" font="5">the brain, the nervous network, and the main organs in order to provide the injured and dying cells with the most </text>
<text top="143" left="9" width="303" height="13" font="5">powerful restorative and food available in the body to save life.</text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">The whole organism now begins to function in a most amazing manner which cannot but strike terror into the stoutest </text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="545" height="13" font="5">heart. Tossed between the old and yet incompletely built new conscious centre, the subject, unprepared for such a </text>

<text top="210" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">rebellious mind and unruly senses and organs working in an inexplicable way, entirely foreign to him, as if the world, </text>
<text top="224" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">suddenly turned upside down, had dragged him to a topsy-turvey existence as weird and bizarre as the most fantastic </text>
<text top="238" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">dream. It is for this reason that the ancient teachers of Kundalini Yoga, taught by an experience extending for thousands </text>
<text top="252" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">of years, insisted on an exceptionally robust and hardy constitution, mastery over appetites and desires, voluntarily </text>
<text top="266" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">acquired control over vital functions and organs, and, above all, the possession of an inflexible will as the essentially </text>
<text top="280" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">needed qualifications in those offering themselves for the supreme undertaking of rousing the Shakti. An excellent </text>
<text top="294" left="9" width="538" height="13" font="5">condition of both body and mind, difficult to achieve in the unfavourable environment of modern civilization, is </text>
<text top="308" left="9" width="527" height="13" font="5">absolutely necessary in an enterprise of this nature to prevent the brain from giving way completely under the </text>
<text top="322" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">unbearable strain. It is not surprising, therefore, that any one who set himself determinedly to the hazardous task of </text>
<text top="336" left="9" width="52" height="13" font="5">awakening</text>
<text top="362" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">Kundalini before her time was acclaimed a Vira, meaning a hero, and the practice itself designated as Vira Sadhana, or </text>
<text top="376" left="9" width="467" height="13" font="5">heroic undertaking, even by fearless ascetics themselves, indifferent to physical torture and death.</text>
<text top="402" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">It should not be thought even for an instant that the alarming alteration in mental processes and the condition of the </text>
<text top="416" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">nervous system tending to produce a most stupefying and bizarre effect on even the most daring, persists for a short </text>
<text top="430" left="9" width="544" height="13" font="5">duration, only to be followed by a return to normality with a mastery over the newly developed powers. After the </text>
<text top="444" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">awakening, the devotee lives always at the mercy of Kundalini, wafted to a new state of existence and introduced to a </text>
<text top="458" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">new world as far removed from this one of rapid change and decay as reality is from a dream. The hypersensitive and </text>
<text top="472" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">critical condition of the nerves and the brain caused by the unceasing effort of the marvellous, invisible power to mould </text>
<text top="485" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">them to a higher and higher state of cognition, the possibility of injury and damage to the over-sensitive tissues, the </text>
<text top="499" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">process of repair and rejuvenation with the administration of nerve tonics and restoratives present in the system, and the </text>
<text top="513" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">tremendous strain on the excessively worked reproductive organs may continue un-diminished for years. The only </text>
<text top="527" left="9" width="540" height="13" font="5">change is that with the lapse of time the individual becomes more and more accustomed to the play of the newly </text>
<text top="541" left="9" width="548" height="13" font="5">developed force in him and is able to regulate his habits and appetites according to the revised requirements of his </text>
<text top="555" left="9" width="230" height="13" font="5">system on the strength of the experience gained.</text>
<text top="581" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">The time of sleep, when the body is at rest and the mind comparatively quiescent, provides the best occasion for the </text>
<text top="595" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">remodelling process to gather momentum by using the surplus energy, dissipated during the day in voluntary physical </text>
<text top="609" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">and mental activity, for reconstructive purposes. This results in a greater flow of the radiant vital energy into the brain </text>
<text top="623" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">with a corresponding amplification of the dream personality and other contents of the dream. The entire matter of the </text>
<text top="637" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">brain is invigorated with a copious flow of the subtle essence, abundantly supplied by the organs of reproduction, which </text>
<text top="651" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">makes it possible for the delicate tissues to maintain their activity at the pitch to which they are raised by the powerful </text>
<text top="665" left="9" width="547" height="13" font="5">vital current streaming into the cephalic cavity, in conformity with the needs of the newly opened centre of higher </text>
<text top="679" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">consciousness. The self-regulating mechanism of the body, trying desperately to adjust itself to the sudden development,</text>
<text top="693" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">lets no opportunity escape to bring about the necessary changes in the organism on every favourable occasion, in spite </text>
<text top="707" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">of the resistance offered, particularly when awake, by the ego consciousness which, acting during the day and dreaming </text>
<text top="721" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">during the night, tossed up and down like a cork floating on the surface of a billowy sea, remains entirely in the dark </text>

<text top="760" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">My dreams had, therefore, a peculiar significance, and from the time of the awakening to the present day they have been</text>

<text top="217" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">denial of some fundamental concepts of religion, of inspired prophet-hood, and of all kinds of spiritual phenomena. If </text>
<text top="231" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">the human system is incapable of developing a brain and nervous activity expressive of a higher form of consciousness </text>

<text top="287" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">suppose without demonstrable proof that, of all living creatures, man alone forms an exception to this rule, it will have </text>
<text top="301" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">to be admitted that an extraordinary development of the human mind, radically different from or strikingly above its </text>
<text top="315" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">normal range of expression, must necessarily be attended by a corresponding change in or development of its biological </text>
<text top="329" left="9" width="76" height="13" font="5">equipment also.</text>
<text top="355" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">The first pertinent question is likely to be how this alteration and development takes place in the face of the fact that for </text>
<text top="369" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">any such activity to be effective it must have existed as a continuous evolutionary process for ages for which the human </text>
<text top="382" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">body, particularly the skull, provides no convincing proof, having exhibited no marked variation for the last thousands </text>
<text top="396" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">of years conspicuous enough to furnish conclusive evidence for a radical change in the brain, the seat of its mental </text>

<text top="466" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">recognition to the validity of spiritual experience and the reality of psychical phenomena is due mainly to the inability of</text>

<text top="238" left="9" width="543" height="13" font="5">pressure which tended to accelerate the organic functions beyond the normal limit. On numerous occasions I was </text>
<text top="252" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">forcibly struck by the resemblance that I bore during those days to a growing baby, utterly unconscious of the great </text>
<text top="266" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">changes occurring in every part of the tiny frame tending to bring it by imperceptible degrees nearer and nearer to the </text>
<text top="280" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">massive proportions of manhood. I closely resembled one in the frequency of intake and more rapid digestion of food, </text>
<text top="294" left="9" width="548" height="13" font="5">quicker and more thorough elimination, longer periods of rest and sleep, and by an abnormal rapidity of the pulse, </text>
<text top="308" left="9" width="547" height="13" font="5">unaccompanied by fever or any other symptoms of illness. It was obvious that under the action of the transformed </text>
<text top="322" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">nervous energy my body functioned in a definitely altered manner in certain respects, forced to greater activity probably </text>
<text top="336" left="9" width="370" height="13" font="5">with some ultimate object in view which I could in no way guess at that time.</text>
<text top="362" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">Apparently my body had become a target for invisible but superintelligent living forces which, using the surplus energy </text>
<text top="376" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">provided by my considerably enhanced intake and better assimilation of food, temperate habits, and frequently long </text>
<text top="390" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">periods of strict continence, were hammering away at my interior, bending and twisting the cells and organs to the </text>

<text top="432" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">under the action of the new vital current made it evident that even in its altered behaviour the organism was following a </text>
<text top="446" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">certain clearly marked rhythm, an essential characteristic of life in any form. This was a matter of great consolation to a </text>
<text top="460" left="9" width="546" height="13" font="5">man like me whose every night was a witness to strange, incomprehensible activities going on in his interior, as it </text>

<text top="501" left="9" width="221" height="13" font="5">chaotic condition had overcome the organism.</text>
<text top="527" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">In the beginning I mistook the normal mode of operation of the new vital energy for a sudden disorder of the nervous </text>

<text top="597" left="9" width="543" height="13" font="5">consciousness of the yogi. In the course of her ascent from her seat at the base of the spine to the crown, she, it is </text>
<text top="611" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">averred, waters with nectar the six lotuses flourishing at the six important nerve junctions on the cerebro-spinal axis, </text>
<text top="625" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">governing the vital and sensory organs which bloom at her approach, until she arrives at the thousand-petalled lotus at </text>
<text top="639" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">the top of the head and is absorbed in ecstatic union with her heavenly consort; when released from the chains which </text>
<text top="653" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">bind it to earth, the embodied consciousness soars to the sublime heights of self-realization, made aware for the first </text>
<text top="667" left="9" width="308" height="13" font="5">time after ages of bondage of its own ineffable, deathless nature.</text>
<text top="693" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">At the time of her descent she repasses the lotuses, which droop and close their petals at her departure, until she assumes</text>
<text top="707" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">her original dormant state at the base of the spine, bringing down with her the temporarily liberated consciousness, </text>
<text top="721" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">adding link after link to the fetter which binds the attributeless, eternal substance inexorably to the flesh until the chain </text>
<text top="735" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">is complete at the last stage, when the yogi, coming down gradually from a condition of unutterable beatitude, awakes </text>
<text top="749" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">again to the world as embodied spirit, dominated by the senses, retaining only a brief but striking memory of its flight </text>
<text top="762" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">into the Infinite. The writings on Hatha Yoga contain graphic descriptions of these lotuses, their exact location, the </text>
<text top="776" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">number of petals on each, the name and form of the presiding deity, the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet associated with </text>
<text top="790" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">them, and the like. The students are enjoined to meditate on them in that form while practising Pranayama, beginning </text>
<text top="804" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">particularly with the lowest, or Muladhara Chakra, close to the abode of the goddess. The centres bearing the lotuses are </text>
<text top="818" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">called Chakras. Five of them are considered to be the centres of vital energy distinguished by thick clusters of nerves </text>

<text top="3" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">situated at different points along the spinal cord, which some modern writers identify with the various Plexuses. The </text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">sixth is said to be located in the brain at a spot corresponding to the point of junction of the two eyebrows and the root </text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="224" height="13" font="5">of the nose, and the seventh is in the cerebrum.</text>
<text top="57" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">Biologically, a healthy human organism with an intelligent brain should provide at its present stage of evolution a fit </text>
<text top="71" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">abode for the manifestation of a higher form of consciousness than that which is the normal endowment of mankind in </text>
<text top="85" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">the present age. Its brain, nervous system, and the vital organs should have attained the state of perfection, according to </text>
<text top="99" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">the evolutionary standard, where a higher personality can step in without much commotion to take over control of the </text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">body. But ages of incorrect living in obedience to the dictates of civilization have played havoc with this most intricate </text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">machine, marring the growth of the organs and the efficiency of the nerves and loading the system with nervous poisons</text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">too subtle to be eliminated by the administration of drugs or other therapeutic agents. This is the main reason why the </text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">present-day human organism, instead of expediting the process, offers a strong resistance to its investiture with a more </text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">potent form of vitality, an essential preliminary to the installation of a higher personality. By no means known to science</text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">can this cleaning and remodelling of the body be done to make it fit for the transfer of power. All systems of Yoga aim </text>
<text top="197" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">at achieving this by overcoming these deficiencies. Kundalini is the mechanism as well as the motive force by which </text>
<text top="210" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">this biological trimming and remodelling is accomplished in the most effective manner, provided the system is not too </text>
<text top="224" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">much deteriorated either by its own defective mode of life or because of a retrogressive heredity. The awakening being a</text>
<text top="238" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">rare but natural biological phenomenon it is futile to enter into a discussion of the reality of the lotuses, on which a good</text>
<text top="252" left="9" width="543" height="13" font="5">deal of emphasis has been laid by the ancient authorities. I did not come across any in the course of my own long </text>
<text top="266" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">adventure, not even a vestige of one in any part of the cerebro-spinal system. To assume their existence even for an </text>
<text top="280" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">instant in these days of physiological knowledge and research would mean nothing short of an insult to intelligence. In </text>
<text top="294" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">all probability their existence was suggested graphically to the disciples with colourful detail as an aid to concentration </text>
<text top="308" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">and to signify the location of the more sensitive and easier-to-effect brain and nerve centres, as well as to symbolize </text>
<text top="322" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">chastity; the lotus flower, unaffected by the condition of water in which it grows, has always served as an emblem of </text>
<text top="336" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">purity. By denying the existence of the lotuses and other accessories associated with them, it is not intended in the least </text>
<text top="350" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">to undervalue or ridicule in any way the colossal work done by the ancient masters, whose achievement in this insecure </text>
<text top="364" left="9" width="299" height="13" font="5">and inaccessible domain has been nothing short of marvellous.</text>
<text top="390" left="9" width="525" height="13" font="5">The idea of Chakras and lotuses must have been suggested to the mind of the ancient teachers by the singular </text>
<text top="404" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">resemblance which, in the awakened state, the lustrous nerve centres bear to a luminous revolving disc, studded with </text>
<text top="418" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">lights, or to a lotus flower in full bloom glistening in the rays of the sun. The circle of glowing radiance round the head, </text>
<text top="432" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">tinged at times with rainbow colours and supported by the thin streak of light moving upward through the spinal duct, </text>
<text top="446" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">bears an unmistakable likeness to a blooming lotus with its thin stalk trailing downwards in water, conveying to it the </text>
<text top="460" left="9" width="535" height="13" font="5">nutritive elements drawn by means of innumerable root fibres, exactly in the same manner as the living stalk of </text>
<text top="474" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">Sushumna supplies the subtle organic essence drawn from every part of the corporeal frame by means of countless nerve</text>
<text top="487" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">filaments to feed the Flame lit by Kundalini. It resembles in effect a gorgeous lotus of extraordinary brilliance, having a </text>
<text top="501" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">thousand petals to denote its large dimensions. In the absence of adequate physiological information the old savants </text>
<text top="515" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">probably could not seize hold of a better method, not only to indicate the position of the nerve clusters which had to </text>
<text top="529" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">become seats of intense activity simultaneously with the awakening, but also to prepare the uninitiated disciples for their</text>
<text top="543" left="9" width="250" height="13" font="5">subsequent brightly illumined lotus-like appearance.</text>
<text top="569" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">I have tried to make the point clear, as readers in the least familiar with the writings on Kundalini are likely to be struck </text>
<text top="583" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">by the singular absence of any reference in this work to Chakras and lotuses, so lavishly dealt with in other books, that a</text>
<text top="597" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">whole literature has grown around them, detracting from the scientific value of the actual phenomenon. I never practised</text>
<text top="611" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">yoga by Tantric methods of which Pranayama, meditation on the nerve centres, and posture are essential features. If I </text>
<text top="625" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">had done so with a firm belief in the existence of the lotuses, I might well have mistaken the luminous formations and </text>
<text top="639" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">the glowing discs of light at the various nerve junctions along the spinal cord for lotuses, and in the excited state of my </text>
<text top="653" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">imagination might even have been led to perceive the letters and the presiding deities in vivid form, suggested by the </text>
<text top="667" left="9" width="548" height="13" font="5">pictures already present in my mind. By the grace of the divine energy I was destined to witness a phenomenon of </text>
<text top="681" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">another kind, a unique phenomenon undoubtedly repeated many times during the past but in all probability seldom </text>
<text top="695" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">studied in detail and certainly never recorded in plain language free of unintelligible words and metaphors. Astounding </text>
<text top="709" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">as it may appear, I am convinced that an emphasis was designedly laid on great suffering to me particularly on such </text>
<text top="723" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">items of the experience as enabled me, though very imperfectly, to trace the biological processes responsible for the </text>
<text top="737" left="9" width="547" height="13" font="5">phenomenon. It is mainly because of this that I am in a position to adduce certain hitherto inexplicable facts, fully </text>
<text top="751" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">confident that the indistinct track, passing zig-zag through the thick undergrowth of superstition and ceremonial, now </text>

<text top="778" left="9" width="34" height="13" font="5">results.</text>
<text top="804" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">I was destined to witness my own transformation, not comparable in any way to the great transfigurations in the past, </text>

<text top="31" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">dogmas of faith, and so antagonistic to many of the universally followed dictums of civilization that when what I have </text>

<text top="85" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">What I realized beyond the least shadow of doubt is the fact, corroborated in part by ancient seers of many lands and </text>

<text top="337" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">sublime beauty, and the concomitant heightened physiological activity, especially sexual. As mentioned above, the</text>
<text top="351" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">vivification of imagination belongs to the white phase, to the activation of the anima. It is remarkable how differently</text>
<text top="365" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">his process moves compared with what goes on in a Western analysis. For us, beautiful dreams are not enough. They</text>
<text top="379" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">must be recorded, worked on, analysed, meaning extracted, integrated. For him, they needed only to be dreamt, felt,</text>
<text top="392" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">followed. Here we come to one of the ways consciousness and ego can be separated and developed independently. As</text>
<text top="406" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">long as we in analysis take up the dream in order to integrate it, we are extending the ego and identifying the extension</text>
<text top="420" left="9" width="545" height="13" font="5">of ego with the extension of consciousness. Our author did things another way. He let the ego sleep in its world of</text>
<text top="434" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">dreams; he observed merely what was going on, trusting (as one would in the white positive anima phase) and letting</text>
<text top="448" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">the process transform him. Rather than let his ego integrate the luminous other world, he let the luminous other world</text>
<text top="462" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">integrate him. His approach to greater awareness was just the reverse of what we assume in the West. We work at it; it</text>
<text top="476" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">requires intense activity. Gopi Krishna slept!—but at the right time and in the right way. Compare St. Bernard's 'alive</text>
<text top="490" left="9" width="270" height="13" font="5">and watchful sleep' which 'enlightens the inward senses'.</text>
<text top="516" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">There is probably a great deal more to the interrelation of <i>dreaming and sexual excitation </i>than we today understand. </text>
<text top="530" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">Freud was the first to see intuitively a connection between the dream world and sexuality. He caged his insight within a </text>
<text top="544" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">strained mechanical system, almost destroying its value, but if we let it take free flight again we can speculate along the </text>
<text top="558" left="9" width="161" height="13" font="5">lines of our author's observations.</text>
<text top="584" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">Assuming with Jung and with Gopi Krishna that Kundalini is the instinct of individuation, this instinct will have at least </text>
<text top="598" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">a strongly sexual component, if not an erotic base. Assuming too with Jung and with Gopi Krishna that dreams play a </text>
<text top="612" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">major role in this process (mainly by preceding the level of awareness of consciousness), then we might speculate that </text>
<text top="626" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">what goes on in the dreams will be influenced by and reflect sexuality. Freud said this of course, but he did not see the </text>
<text top="640" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">purposeful individuating aspect. Worse, he reduced the dream to sexuality, whereas Gopi Krishna sees sexuality in the </text>
<text top="654" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">service of the dream. Recent research in the physiology of sleep shows penile erections synchronous with dreams. In </text>
<text top="667" left="9" width="547" height="13" font="5">general, during periods of dreaming there is erection; during periods of non-dreaming, there is detumescence. The </text>
<text top="681" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">experimenters speculate that the same biological system may be responsible for both activities. We would call this </text>
<text top="695" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">system the psychoid level; Gopi Krishna might call it Kundalini. Fantasy and sexual excitation seem to be two sides of </text>
<text top="709" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">the same activity. In Freudian psychoanalysis fantasy is to be reduced to its sexual origins so that sexuality can serve its </text>
<text top="723" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">ultimately extraverted biological purpose. In Kundalini Yoga, it would seem that sexuality is to be converted in order to </text>
<text top="737" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">feed its ultimately introverted biological purpose. Jungian analysis might be said to take a middle position; sexuality </text>
<text top="751" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">flows on a sliding scale, at one time expressed mainly in images, at another time mainly in actions. In all three views, </text>
<text top="765" left="9" width="291" height="13" font="5">the sexual permeation of the unconscious is clearly affirmed.</text>
<text top="791" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">A direct connection between <i>brain and testicles </i>via the spine is a physiological axiom in Indian, Chinese, Tibetan, </text>
<text top="805" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">Arabic, and ancient Greek medicine. We have no modern anatomical evidence for this connection. Rather than dismiss </text>
<text top="819" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">the idea as superstition, we may reinterpret it as a psychological truth, i.e. between the two creative centres of man there </text>
</page>
<page number="63" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="842" width="595">
<text top="3" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">is a direct relationship; man's backbone holding him upright expresses this relationship between the two poles of his </text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="28" height="13" font="5">force.</text>
<text top="43" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">The sexual union between head and genitals experienced physiologically by our author is presented in alchemy as the</text>
<text top="57" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">conjunction of male and female opposites (King and Queen, Sun and Moon, red and white, etc.). Often the metaphor of</text>
<text top="71" left="9" width="524" height="13" font="5">brother-sister incest is used. Psychologically, this conjunction means the union with oneself, self-fertilization,</text>
<text top="85" left="9" width="548" height="13" font="5">self-generation, and self-creation. The intensive prolonged introversion of one's libido, the devoted love which one</text>
<text top="99" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">lavishes upon one's own psychic life, the joyful acceptance of all biological desire and sexual excitation as belonging to</text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">and furthering the process going on in the psychic, imaginative world, endowing one's own genitals with the sanctity of</text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="544" height="13" font="5">a God—all this is meant by the union of crown and seed. The actual moment of the inner conjunction is said to be</text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="544" height="13" font="5">comparable to orgasm (see Chapter Fourteen). From this comes the divine child, the second birth of the new man.</text>
<text top="167" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">We are therefore not surprised to discover our author experiencing himself as a 'growing baby'. Again his experiences</text>
<text top="181" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">were not in fantasy images or dreams of birth and infancy (as we often find in analysis), but in the organic experience</text>
<text top="195" left="9" width="523" height="13" font="5">within himself of these changes. He lived through the archetypal experiences, naively, in the best sense of the</text>
<text top="208" left="9" width="186" height="13" font="5">word—simply, naturally, unaffectedly.</text>
<text top="234" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">As our author says, in the standard works of Kundalini Yoga and Hatha Yoga, and Chinese Yoga as well, there are </text>
<text top="248" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">chakras, distinct centres of experience located in the body, each with an elaborate symbolism of colour, number, animal,</text>
<text top="262" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">God, element, and body organ or system. Gopi Krishna did not have these experiences, although he explains how it </text>
<text top="276" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">might be possible for one to have viewed the circles of light as petaled chakras. For him there were no lotuses. We are </text>
<text top="290" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">reminded of his suffering. However, the organic experiences he sensed do correspond with the emphasis in these yogic </text>
<text top="304" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">systems upon <i>physiological reality </i>and upon the changes in vital centres and organs expected once the Kundalini is </text>
<text top="318" left="9" width="226" height="13" font="5">aroused and the light or breath is in circulation.</text>
<text top="344" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">The question arises: did these events actually take place in his body, in his cells, nerves, organs? Or did they take place </text>
<text top="358" left="9" width="545" height="13" font="5">in the yogic body? Bharati says <i>(op. cit., </i>p. 291): 'The physical and the yogic body belong to two different logical </text>
<text top="372" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">levels.' The chakra system of the yogic body is not supposed to have any objective existence in physical space. Yet the </text>
<text top="386" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">psyche insists on this body language and body experience so that what is logically impossible is indeed psychologically </text>
<text top="400" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">not only possible but felt to be true. Thus for Gopi Krishna this question does not arise. His experiences were definitely </text>
<text top="414" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">physical and in his body, his flesh afire, his organs affected, his appetites altered. <i>Prana </i>connects the two levels, which</text>
<text top="428" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">are really but one identity which our minds divide into two logics. Physiologists—and there have been some—may</text>
<text top="442" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">examine the physical body during <i>samadhi </i>for traces of its alteration and thus may demonstrate the effect upon the </text>
<text top="456" left="9" width="545" height="13" font="5">physical body of changes in the yogic body. But the psychologist starts with the psychic data which follows Gopi </text>
<text top="469" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">Krishna's report: his physical body was for him the material place of projection of immaterial events and there in the </text>
<text top="483" left="9" width="578" height="13" font="5">'body' they were experienced by the senses and felt to be 'real'. Evidently, there must be some <i>material place </i>for psychic </text>
<text top="497" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">changes: the object of art, the alchemical materials, the physical body. In our Western tradition we have come far in </text>
<text top="511" left="9" width="526" height="13" font="5">knowledge of the reality of the physical body, and are comparatively ignorant of the reality of the body of the </text>
<text top="525" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">imagination. We do not understand enough about the effects of the imaginal body upon our physiology, not only in </text>
<text top="539" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">psychosomatic symptoms, but in all illness and its treatment. Our author's account shows how intimately the two 'logical</text>
<text top="553" left="9" width="164" height="13" font="5">levels' merge in actual experience.</text>
<text top="579" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">Because his report does not follow the standard examples of an ascent throught distinct chakras, it is just that more </text>
<text top="593" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">valuable. The alchemists too complained that the literature was obscure and useless: no one could learn how to make the</text>
<text top="607" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">Stone from anyone else. Each had to do the work alone. So, too, in analysis, no two processes move in the same way, </text>
<text top="621" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">produce the same patterning of symbols and motifs, yield the same emotional experiences. Each case is individual and </text>
<text top="635" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">each relationship between analyst and analysand is different. In this sense it is always a creative endeavour. One must </text>
<text top="649" left="9" width="522" height="13" font="5">make and follow one's own way. The archetype of in-dividuation may be said to be single, its manifestations </text>
<text top="663" left="9" width="69" height="13" font="5">multitudinous.</text>

<text top="71" left="9" width="539" height="13" font="5">Looking back now at the years which followed the awakening, I can affirm unhesitatingly that but for the robust </text>
<text top="85" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">constitution bequeathed to me by my parents and certain good traits of character inherited or learned from them, I could </text>
<text top="99" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">never have survived the ordeal and lived to relate it. Although for many years of my altered life I never breathed freely </text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">like a man sure of himself and of what he had to do, and I was at no time entirely without doubt about my condition, I </text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">managed by adopting an attitude of calm resignation to the inevitable and indifference to death, partly the effect of </text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">parental influence and partly cultivation, to keep my mind undisturbed even in grave situations. Often they were caused </text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">by my own neglect of the conditions regulating my peculiar existence, unavoidable due to the storm and stress of life, </text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">and sometimes by attacks of common ailments for each of which I had to discover and apply the treatment by trial and </text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="234" height="13" font="5">error suited to the changed reactions of my body.</text>
<text top="208" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">An ordinary man in a humble walk of life, burdened with responsibilities, as I always have been and think myself to be, </text>
<text top="222" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">I never allowed any false idea about myself to take root in my mind after the new development. On the other hand, my </text>
<text top="236" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">absolute helplessness before the lately manifest power in me had the effect of humbling what little remnant of pride I </text>
<text top="250" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">still possessed. I attended to all my affairs in the same manner as I had always done before the change. The only thing to</text>
<text top="264" left="9" width="538" height="13" font="5">remind me of the internal upheaval was rigid regularity in diet and an adherence to certain other austere ways of </text>
<text top="278" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">conduct, which experience taught me to adopt in order to minimize resistance to the activity of the mighty energy at </text>
<text top="292" left="9" width="77" height="13" font="5">work inside me.</text>
<text top="318" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">I lived outwardly a strictly normal life, permitting no one, save my devoted wife, to have the least glimpse into the </text>
<text top="332" left="9" width="540" height="13" font="5">mysterious happenings in my interior. Every year I moved to Jammu in winter with my office and to Kashmir in </text>
<text top="346" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">summer, in this manner to escape the rigour of heat and cold which might have proved injurious to the growth of the </text>
<text top="360" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">supersensitive tissues then in a state of development within. Gradually in the course of a few years my body attained a </text>
<text top="374" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">degree of hardiness and strength sufficient to withstand the effect of fasts, discomforts of travel, rigours of climate, </text>
<text top="388" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">irregularities in diet, overstrain, worries, and adverse circumstances which form an inevitable corollary to the struggle </text>
<text top="402" left="9" width="64" height="13" font="5">for existence.</text>
<text top="428" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">I became almost my old self again, humbled and chastened by the experience, with a good deal less of ego and a great </text>
<text top="442" left="9" width="540" height="13" font="5">deal more of faith in the Unseen Arbitrator of human destiny. The only thing I was aware of was a progressively </text>
<text top="456" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">expanding field of consciousness and a slowly increasing brightness of the external and internal objects of perception, </text>
<text top="469" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">which in course of time brought the idea irresistibly home to me that though outwardly one with the restlessly active </text>
<text top="483" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">mass of humanity, I was a different being inside, living in a lustrous world of brilliant colour of which others had no </text>
<text top="497" left="9" width="113" height="13" font="5">knowledge whatsoever.</text>
<text top="523" left="9" width="522" height="13" font="5">In mentioning apparently minor details I am influenced by the consideration that I should not omit any facts. </text>
<text top="537" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">Transformation of personality is fraught with risks, needing attention to every phase of conduct and careful regulation of</text>
<text top="551" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">activity. If all I have to relate was known but a few centuries earlier, the knowledge properly systematized and applied </text>
<text top="565" left="9" width="390" height="13" font="5">might have helped physicians to save many persons from the clutches of insanity.</text>
<text top="591" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">It was my great ill luck not to have understood for many years what I have learned now after repeated bitter struggles. </text>
<text top="605" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">Side by side with the suffering, however, I have also tasted moments of incomparable happiness, supreme moments </text>
<text top="619" left="9" width="508" height="13" font="5">which liberally compensated me for long periods of pain and anguish, as the mere act of waking to reality </text>
<text top="633" left="9" width="449" height="13" font="5">instantaneously compensates a sleeper for the awful agony suffered in a prolonged nightmare.</text>
<text top="659" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">About three years after the incidents narrated in the preceding chapters, I began to feel an irresistible desire for a more </text>
<text top="673" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">nourishing and substantial diet than that to which I had accustomed myself from the time of the awakening. The desire </text>
<text top="687" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">was more in evidence in winter when I was in Jammu than in the months of summer spent in Kashmir. Those were the </text>
<text top="701" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">closing years of the Second World War and the prices of commodities had risen enormously. Unable to assign any </text>
<text top="715" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">reasons for the sudden excess in a now otherwise normal appetite, I restrained the inclination because I considered it </text>
<text top="729" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">improper to give way to a desire which had something of a gourmand in it and also because our extremely limited means</text>
<text top="743" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">did not allow me the additional expenditure. Despite meagre resources our diet was sufficiently nutritious and balanced, </text>
<text top="756" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">including certain varieties of animal food, against which Kashmiri Brahmins as a community do not have any scruple. </text>
<text top="770" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">But the urge in me was not without good reason, and I had to pay bitterly for my shortsighted resistance to an impulse </text>
<text top="784" left="9" width="352" height="13" font="5">intended to expedite the process going on as strong as ever in my interior.</text>
<text top="810" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">Soon after our annual move to Jammu in the month of November 1943 I received an invitation from my relatives in </text>
<text top="824" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">Multan to spend a few days with them during the ensuing winter. As it afforded me an opportunity to meet my cousins </text>

<page number="65" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="842" width="595">
<text top="3" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">whom I had not seen for many years, I determined to accept the invitation and to go there during the Christmas holidays,</text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">extending the period by a few more days if necessary. That year, feeling particularly fit and strong, I left my wife at </text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">Srinagar and came alone to Jammu to stay with her brother, the municipal engineer of the town. He hired a building in </text>
<text top="45" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">an open locality on the outskirts of the town where, having a room all to myself and finding all my simple needs well </text>
<text top="59" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">provided for, I felt entirely at home, happy at the change and harbouring not the slightest suspicion that all my cheer </text>
<text top="73" left="9" width="234" height="13" font="5">would vanish in the horror of another awful trial.</text>
<text top="99" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">I was happy to find myself in full possession of my normal health with a surplus amount of energy demanding an outlet.</text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">From early November I started taking easy physical exercises, beginning with the first grey streaks of dawn and ending </text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">with the sun just near the horizon, after which I had a cold bath and retired to my room for rest and study until office </text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">time. I do not know how it happened, but after only a few weeks of the programme the urge to take exercise partially </text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">disappeared, yielding place to a strong, almost irresistible desire for meditation. The glow of vibrant health resulting </text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">from systematic exertion made me feel reckless, and looking for an avenue to make the best use of my superb physical </text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="533" height="13" font="5">condition, I felt half inclined to yield to the impulse and try my luck again, swayed by the thought that with the </text>
<text top="197" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">experience gained and the immunity acquired by the organism I might succeed without encountering the mishap I had </text>
<text top="210" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">suffered last time. I had escaped by a miracle to pass years of uncertainty and suspense before I found myself again on </text>
<text top="224" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">firm ground. What an imbecile I was, I sternly told myself, not to profit by my previous extremely bitter experience and </text>
<text top="238" left="9" width="471" height="13" font="5">to expose myself again to the same ghastly battle the wounds of which were still fresh in my heart.</text>
<text top="264" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">In spite of my sober reflections, in spite of myself, in spite of the suffering I had borne in consequence of it, I again </text>
<text top="278" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">began to meditate, starting from the early hours or dawn, losing myself in the contemplation of the wondering lustrous </text>
<text top="292" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">glow within, until the sun, risen high above the horizon, shone full in my room, indicating the nearness of the office </text>
<text top="306" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">hour. I began to practise from the first week of December; for a number of days in addition to the marvellous extension </text>
<text top="320" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">of personality and absorption in the enrapturing conscious glow that I had experienced on the first day of the awakening,</text>
<text top="334" left="9" width="542" height="13" font="5">differing only in the colour of the radiance, I felt a sense of elation and power impossible to describe. It persisted </text>
<text top="348" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">through the day and in my dreams to the hour of practice, and was replenished again the next morning to last for another</text>
<text top="362" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">day. Astounded at the result of my effort, I increased the interval by beginning earlier, completely overpowered by the </text>
<text top="376" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">wonder and glory of the vision which, luring away my senses from the harsh world of mingled joy and pain, carried me </text>
<text top="390" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">to a supersensory plane where, caressed by lustrous waves of indescribable rapture, I found myself immersed in the </text>
<text top="404" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">boundless ocean of unconditioned being. It was indeed a marvellous experience, and I felt my hair literally stand on end </text>
<text top="418" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">when the stupendous vision wore its most majestic aspect. It seemed on every such occasion as if I or the invisible </text>
<text top="432" left="9" width="542" height="13" font="5">cognitive self in me, leaving its safe anchorage in the flesh, were carried by the strong outgoing tide of a lustrous </text>
<text top="446" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">consciousness towards an existence of such immensity and power as made everything I could conceive of on earth tame </text>
<text top="460" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">and trite in comparison: an existence where, untroubled by any idea of bondage or limitation, I found myself lost in an</text>
<text top="474" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">amazing immaterial universe so stupendous in extent, so sublime and marvellous in nature, that the human element still </text>
<text top="487" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">left in me, even when at the highest point of the experience, stared in amazement and trembled with awe at the mighty </text>
<text top="501" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">spectacle present before my internal eye. I was overjoyed at the glorious possibility within my reach now. There could </text>
<text top="515" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">be absolutely no doubt that I was the exceedingly fortunate possessor of an awakened Kundalini. It was only now that I </text>
<text top="529" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">could grasp the reason why in ancient times success in this undertaking was thought to be the highest achievement </text>
<text top="543" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">possible to man and why the followers of this path considered no sacrifice too much and no effort too great for the </text>
<text top="557" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">supreme prize attainable at the end. I now understood why accomplished Yogis were always treated with the highest </text>
<text top="571" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">respect in India and how adepts, who had lived long ago, even now commanded a homage and a reverence which have </text>
<text top="585" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">not fallen to the share of any other class of men, including mighty rulers and potentates. There was certainly no honour </text>
<text top="599" left="9" width="508" height="13" font="5">more signal or fortune more precious than that which, without my asking for it, had been bestowed on me.</text>
<text top="625" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">But, alas, my good luck was exceedingly short-lived. After only a couple of weeks I found that the ferment caused in my</text>
<text top="639" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">mind by the breathtaking experience was so great that I could hardly sleep for excitement and was awake hours before </text>
<text top="653" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">the time of meditation, impatient to induce the blissful condition again as soon as possible. The impressions of the last </text>
<text top="667" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">three days terminating this extraordinary period of excursions into the normally forbidden domain of the supersensible </text>
<text top="681" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">are indelibly imprinted upon my memory. Before losing myself entirely in the contemplation of an unbounded, glowing,</text>
<text top="695" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">conscious void, I distinctly felt an incomparably blissful sensation in all my nerves moving from the tips of fingers and </text>
<text top="709" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">toes and other parts of the trunk and limbs towards the spine, where, concentrated and intensified, it mounted upwards </text>
<text top="723" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">with a still more exquisitely pleasant feeling to pour into the upper region of the brain a rapturous and exhilarating </text>
<text top="737" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">stream of a rare radiating nerve secretion. In the absence of a more suitable appellation, I call it nectar, a name given to </text>
<text top="751" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">it by the ancient savants. All authorities on Kundalini Yoga are agreed about the reality of the ambrosial current, which </text>
<text top="764" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">irrigates the seventh centre in the brain at the moment of the union of Shakti with Shiva, the superconscious principle </text>
<text top="778" left="9" width="578" height="13" font="5">behind the embodied self, and it is said that the flow of the nectar into it or into one of the lower centres on spinal axis is </text>
<text top="792" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">always accompanied by a most exquisite rapture impossible to describe, exceeding many times in intensity that most </text>
<text top="806" left="9" width="412" height="13" font="5">pleasurable of bodily sensations, the orgasm, which marks the climax of sexual union.</text>

<text top="3" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">On the last day of this unique experience I had no sleep during the night. My mind was in a state of excitement and </text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">turmoil with joy and exhilaration at this most unexpected and unbelievable stroke of luck. I rose up at my usual time in a</text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">hurry and after feasting my mental eye on the elevating beauty and grandeur that was now a reality for me, went to the </text>
<text top="45" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">market to make some purchases. I returned at nearly one o'clock in the afternoon in an unusual state of exhaustion which</text>
<text top="59" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">surprised me. I had not taken my breakfast that day and accordingly attributed my weakness to an empty stomach. The </text>
<text top="73" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">next day, the twenty-fifth of December, I had to leave for Multan by the morning train to see my cousins. I remained </text>
<text top="87" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">busy until evening, making preparations for the journey, and after dining at the usual hour retired early to bed. Only a </text>
<text top="101" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">few minutes after lying down the stark realization came to me that I had woefully blundered again. My head reeled, my </text>
<text top="115" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">ears buzzed with a harsh, discordant noise, and in place of the usual resplendent glow in my head a wide column of fire </text>
<text top="129" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">was mounting up, shooting out forked tongues of flame in every direction. Trembling with fear, I watched the awful </text>
<text top="143" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">display. Too late I understood what had happened. I had overdone the practice of meditation and strained my already </text>
<text top="157" left="9" width="253" height="13" font="5">over-stimulated nervous system to a dangerous limit.</text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">It is needless for me to recapitulate all the incidents and details of the torture that I suffered again on this occasion for </text>
<text top="197" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">more than three months. Suffice it to say that after passing a terribly restless night I did not feel fit to undertake the long </text>
<text top="210" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">journey to Multan in the morning and was compelled to abandon the idea. Discarding meditation I again took all care to </text>
<text top="224" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">regulate my diet as I had done the last time. In a few days I noticed a slight relief in the tension in my head, but the </text>
<text top="238" left="9" width="259" height="13" font="5">insomnia grew worse and I became weaker every day.</text>
<text top="264" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">Alarmed at my condition, my brother-in-law expressed his intention of writing to my wife to come to Jammu. It was the </text>
<text top="278" left="9" width="547" height="13" font="5">middle of January now and the winding mountainous roads from Srinagar were covered with snow, making travel </text>
<text top="292" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">extremely uncomfortable and even risky. Anxious to avoid her inconvenience as well as a shock, I dissuaded him from </text>
<text top="306" left="9" width="315" height="13" font="5">doing so hoping that the disturbance would cease after some time.</text>
<text top="332" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">One day, finding that I was unable to rise from bed without assistance and losing all hope of survival, I yielded to the </text>
<text top="346" left="9" width="310" height="13" font="5">exhortations of my brother-in-law to send a telegram to my wife.</text>
<text top="372" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">She arrived in all haste, half dead with anxiety, accompanied by her father and my younger son. Day and night without </text>
<text top="386" left="9" width="538" height="13" font="5">an hour's undisturbed rest for herself my wife waited on me, attending to my every need, trying to soothe by her </text>
<text top="400" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">presence the internal agony I was suffering, which she could not visualize in all its horror but the external indications of </text>
<text top="414" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">which she could see every moment without difficulty. My father-in-law, whose parental love and solicitude for me had </text>
<text top="428" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">impelled him to undertake the arduous journey to Jammu despite his age, was beside himself with grief and anxiety at </text>
<text top="442" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">my precarious condition, but restrained by a feeling of awe, which all those who surrounded me at the time felt in spite </text>
<text top="456" left="9" width="333" height="13" font="5">of themselves, he made no attempt to offer any suggestions or advice.</text>
<text top="481" left="9" width="544" height="13" font="5">Alarmed by the seriousness of my condition and unable to think of any other way, as a last resort and without my </text>
<text top="495" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">knowledge they decided to take experienced sadhus and fakirs into their confidence. But all those who were brought to </text>
<text top="509" left="9" width="543" height="13" font="5">treat me expressed their inability to do anything. One of them, a venerable saint hoary with age, then on a visit to </text>
<text top="523" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">Jammu, whom thousands flocked to see every day, after listening to me attentively shook his head, saying that he had </text>
<text top="537" left="9" width="544" height="13" font="5">not heard of anything like it in his life and suggested that I should seek directions from the same teacher who had </text>
<text top="551" left="9" width="261" height="13" font="5">prescribed the practice responsible for the disturbance.</text>
<text top="577" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">Growing more desperate with my progressively worsening condition, they ultimately approached a Kashmiri Sadhu </text>
<text top="591" left="9" width="545" height="13" font="5">staying at Lahore in those days and persuaded him to come to Jammu to see me. He stayed with us for some days </text>
<text top="605" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">studying my condition attentively. I had now grown extremely weak, almost exhausted, with spindle legs and emaciated </text>
<text top="619" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">arms, a skeleton with gleaming eyes, which made my wife wince every time she looked at me. For more than a month I </text>
<text top="633" left="9" width="541" height="13" font="5">had starved myself, subsisting on barely half a cup of boiled rice and a cup of milk two or three times a day. The </text>
<text top="647" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">poisoned condition of my nerves caused by acute digestive disturbances had translated itself into an ungovernable fear </text>
<text top="661" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">of eating because of a constant threat of dreadful consequence. I should have preferred not to eat anything at all, but </text>
<text top="675" left="9" width="548" height="13" font="5">knowing well that a completely empty stomach meant a dreadful death, in spite of the nausea and the revolt of my </text>
<text top="689" left="9" width="363" height="13" font="5">stomach, I used all my will power to perform the extremely unpleasant task.</text>
<text top="715" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">Unable to penetrate the cause of my distemper, the learned sadhu, imputing my dislike for food to a whim, asked me to </text>
<text top="729" left="9" width="535" height="13" font="5">eat in his presence, directing that the full quantity I was accustomed to take be served to me. On his insistence I </text>
<text top="743" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">swallowed with great difficulty a few morsels more than my usual intake, washing them down with water to overcome </text>
<text top="756" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">the resistance offered by my throat. The moment I did so a sudden unbearable stab of pain shot across my abdomen and </text>
<text top="770" left="9" width="533" height="13" font="5">the area round the sacral plexus, attaining such an intensity that I fell prostrate, writhing and twisting, casting a </text>
<text top="784" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">reproachful look at the sadhu for thus subjecting me to torture by his ill-timed advice. Pale with mortification, he rose </text>
<text top="798" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">hurriedly and left the room. That evening he was attacked by a sudden sickness which kept him on his feet for the entire </text>
<text top="812" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">night without sleep, and he left the house in the early hours of the morning, attributing his own malady to the terrible </text>
</page>
<page number="67" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="842" width="595">
<text top="3" left="9" width="104" height="13" font="5">power possessing me.</text>
<text top="29" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">I recovered from the pain in a few hours without any serious after-effects, but the incident exposed the helplessness of </text>
<text top="43" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">my condition as being entirely beyond human aid and added immensely to the worry of my wife. Some days after the </text>
<text top="57" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">episode my son came into my room accidentally with a small plate of food in his chubby little hands. It was about noon. </text>
<text top="71" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">As usual I had taken a few spoonfuls of rice, my principal meal of the day, an hour before. The boy squatted down in </text>
<text top="85" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">front of me and began to eat, licking his lips and enjoying each mouthful in the manner of children. Unlike other times, </text>
<text top="99" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">the sight of food caused no revulsion, and as I watched the child eating with delight I felt the dim stirrings of hunger for </text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">the first time in weeks. In place of the usual bitterness I noticed a reawakened sense of taste in my mouth. I could have </text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">eaten a few morsels with appetite at that time, but the fear of the awful consequences which followed the slightest error </text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">in diet in that hypertense condition restrained me and I could not gather strength enough to take the risk and ask for </text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">something to eat. After only a few minutes the feeling disappeared and the old chaotic condition overcame me again.</text>
<text top="181" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">Puzzled at the occurrence, which could not fail to strike me forcibly even in that distraught condition, I racked my brain </text>
<text top="195" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">to find a satisfactory explanation for the apparently trifling incident, full of the greatest import for me. Could it be, I </text>
<text top="208" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">asked myself, that the interval between the meals set by me was too long in my present debilitated condition? The next </text>
<text top="222" left="9" width="532" height="13" font="5">day I paid scrupulous attention to time, taking a few mouthfuls with a cup of milk every three hours, each time </text>
<text top="236" left="9" width="547" height="13" font="5">unwillingly and with fear gripping my heart. But I managed to carry out my purpose without noticing any adverse </text>
<text top="250" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">consequences, though there was no perceptible improvement either. I continued in this manner for a few days, but the </text>
<text top="264" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">condition of my brain was deteriorating and the convulsive movements of my limbs coupled with intensely painful </text>
<text top="278" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">sensations along the path of nerves, especially in back and abdomen, signified a serious disorder of the nervous system. </text>
<text top="292" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">I felt myself sinking and even the will to live which had sustained me so far appeared ready to give up the struggle as </text>
<text top="306" left="9" width="216" height="13" font="5">hopeless and to let the body drift to its doom.</text>
<text top="332" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">After some days I noticed with a shock that I was slightly delirious at times. I had still enough sense to realize that if the </text>
<text top="346" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">condition worsened I was doomed. I had tried all expedients, used all my intelligence and exhausted all my resources, </text>
<text top="360" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">but had failed miserably to find a way out. Finally, losing every hope of recovery and apprehending the worst in a mood</text>
<text top="374" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">of utter depression, I prepared myself for death, resolved to end my life before the delirium of madness rendered the task</text>
<text top="388" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">impossible. Overwhelmed by the horror which surrounded me, I had now almost lost the power to think rationally or to </text>
<text top="402" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">exert my will to resist the dread impulse. Before going to bed that night I embraced my wife with enfeebled, palsied </text>
<text top="416" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">arms for a long time, noting with anguish her pinched face, and with burning tears in my eyes I resigned her to God, in </text>
<text top="430" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">pain at the idea of the inevitable separation ahead, leaving me no opportunity now to repay her with redoubled love for </text>
<text top="444" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">her unparalleled loyalty and sacrifice. Calling both my sons to me by name, I embraced them fondly, clasping each to </text>
<text top="458" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">my breast, entrusting them also to His care for ever and ever. With a wrench at the heart I remembered that I could not </text>
<text top="472" left="9" width="392" height="13" font="5">have a last look at my dear daughter, who was at Srinagar looking after the house.</text>
<text top="497" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">Resigning her also to God and looking for the last time at her image in my mind, I recovered my breath and stretching </text>
<text top="511" left="9" width="459" height="13" font="5">my aching body on the bed, closed my eyes, unable to stifle the great sobs that shook my breast.</text>
<text top="537" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">It took me some time to grow a little composed after what I had thought was my last adieu to my wife and children, </text>
<text top="551" left="9" width="542" height="13" font="5">believing death to be inevitable. Then I began to think seriously about my resolve. It was foolish to expect, I told </text>
<text top="565" left="9" width="540" height="13" font="5">myself, that if the malady were allowed to run its course I would have a peaceful end. Death would definitely be </text>
<text top="579" left="9" width="547" height="13" font="5">preceded by a raging madness which I had to avoid at any cost. Arguing in this manner I revolved in my mind the </text>
<text top="593" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">various methods within my reach to end my life, trying to select the one which was the easiest and the least painful, </text>
<text top="607" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">possible of execution by one in an extremely weak condition. I weighed the possibilities, passing now and again into a </text>
<text top="621" left="9" width="546" height="13" font="5">delirious condition, all the while tossing from side to side in the relentless grip of unconquerable insomnia. Hours </text>
<text top="635" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">passed and my agitated brain refused to come to a decision, passing from one hazy chain of thought to another, without </text>
<text top="649" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">the power to complete any. I cannot say how it happened that towards the early hours or dawn I passed into a sleeplike </text>
<text top="663" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">condition, the first in weeks, and for a brief interval dreamed a vivid dream in which I saw myself seated at a meal with </text>
<text top="677" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">a half-filled plate in front of me, containing boiled rice and a meat preparation common in Kashmir which I ate with </text>
<text top="691" left="9" width="53" height="13" font="5">enjoyment.</text>
<text top="717" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">I awoke immediately, the lustre noticed in the dream persisting during wakefulness for some time. A sudden idea darted </text>
<text top="731" left="9" width="530" height="13" font="5">across my now almost delirious mind, and calling my wife to my side, in a weak voice I asked her to serve me </text>

<text top="772" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">and served the food to me at the specified intervals, punctual to the minute. I ate mechanically, my arms and hands </text>

<text top="129" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">of this period fruits and a little curd to my diet. Gradually the signs of delirium vanished and the insomnia gave way to </text>
<text top="143" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">an excessive desire for sleep. I submitted willingly to the beneficial soporific influence day and night, awaking only at </text>
<text top="157" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">the time of eating in obedience to the gentle and cautious touch of my wife, who stayed in the kitchen all day preparing </text>
<text top="171" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">meal after meal and serving hot, appetizing dishes with a love and care which only a devoted wife can display. Thanks </text>
<text top="185" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">to her ministrations, stringent regard to time, and the excellence of the food, I began to grow in strength and in about </text>

<text top="213" left="9" width="246" height="13" font="5">reducing to some extent the intake of food in a day.</text>
<text top="239" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">Refreshed by sleep, my mind grew clearer, escaping by degrees the horror; in spite of the fact that the vital radiation had</text>
<text top="253" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">now assumed a colossal appearance, I began to feel a growing sense of confidence in myself and to hope that if nothing </text>
<text top="267" left="9" width="299" height="13" font="5">untoward happened I might pass the crisis with safety after all.</text>
<text top="293" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">As if guided by a newly developed sense of taste I selected the constituents of every meal, rejecting this article and </text>
<text top="307" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">taking more of that, choosing a combination of acids and alkalis, sugars and salts, fruits and vegetables, in a manner that</text>
<text top="321" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">helped my stomach to digest the enormously increased mass under the stimulation of the new more powerful radiant </text>
<text top="335" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">current without any undesirable reaction. I was now passing through an experience as amazing and weird as any I had </text>
<text top="349" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">passed so far, utterly bewildered by the new direction taken by my singularly functioning organism. No man in his </text>
<text top="363" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">senses would believe such an abnormal performance of his digestive organs possible all of a sudden, turning one from a </text>
<text top="376" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">moderate eater into a voracious one; my stomach, working under the stimulation of a fiery vapour, consumed incredible </text>
<text top="390" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">quantities without causing the slightest adverse effect, as if licked up by fire. I had heard and read of yogis said to have </text>
<text top="404" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">commanded incredible powers of digestion, who could consume without ill effects prodigious loads of food with the aid</text>
<text top="418" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">of the luminous energy, but I had never lent credence to such stories. What I had disbelieved I now witnessed in myself, </text>
<text top="432" left="9" width="454" height="13" font="5">all the time overwhelmed with wonder at the powers and possibilities lying hidden in the body.</text>
<text top="458" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">I was not so much alarmed by the voracity of my appetite as I was amazed at the capacity of my stomach. At the lowest </text>
<text top="472" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">computation I was consuming at least four times the amount of food I was used to before the occurrence. During the </text>
<text top="486" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">first week the quantity devoured must have been six times the normal amount. It was atrocious. The food disappeared in </text>
<text top="500" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">my stomach as if it had evaporated, no doubt sucked greedily by the hungry cells of the body. A disregard of time in </text>
<text top="514" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">eating was always visited with a sudden cessation of the desire for food and an absence of taste, aggravated at times to a </text>
<text top="528" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">feeling of nausea and utter dislike for any kind of nourishment. Experience had taught me that such symptoms indicate a</text>
<text top="542" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">poisoned state of nerves, an inevitable result of the awakening in the first stages, for which there is no known antidote </text>
<text top="556" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">except proper feeding in spite of the aversion, done in a manner as may be indicated by the habits and the condition of </text>
<text top="570" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">the system. One should take care to use only the best, most easily digestible, complete natural foods in such a quantity </text>
<text top="584" left="9" width="580" height="13" font="5">as can be readily tolerated at regular intervals, normally of not more than three hours. The availability of a nutritious diet </text>
<text top="598" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">in the stomach is essential in all normal cases and has, therefore, to be arranged with due care to enable the nervous </text>
<text top="612" left="9" width="156" height="13" font="5">system to rid itself of impurities.</text>
<text top="638" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">At the present moment we are entirely in the dark about the nature of the subtle organic essence in the body which </text>
<text top="652" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">serves as nourishment for the ever-active nerves and the constantly fleeting nervous and thought energy. In the first </text>
<text top="665" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">stages of the awakening and until the system grows accustomed to the flow of the radiant current, the one and the only </text>
<text top="679" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">preservative of life and sanity is diet in right measure, correct combination, and at proper intervals. The whole science of</text>
<text top="693" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">Kundalini is fundamentally based on the assumption that it is possible for one to rouse to activity a mighty dormant </text>
<text top="707" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">power in the human body in order to gain freedom from sense domination for the embodied spirit, enabling it to soar </text>
<text top="721" left="9" width="579" height="13" font="5">unfettered to its celestial estate. The idea of stirring to activity a dormant vital force in the body, examined in the light of </text>
<text top="735" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">modern knowledge, can only signify the development or generation of a new type of vitality or life energy which clearly</text>
<text top="749" left="9" width="407" height="13" font="5">implies a recasting of the nervous system not possible without a biological evolution.</text>
<text top="775" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">In the initial stages and later as well, nourishment suited to their appetite and constitution is taken by the initiates in </text>
<text top="789" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">surprising quantities as an offering to the power within. Aversion from food is a common feature in cases of a sudden </text>
<text top="803" left="9" width="539" height="13" font="5">awakening of Kundalini; the abrupt release of the new force and its stormy dash through the nerves causes acute </text>

<text top="169" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">We travelled to Srinagar in the beginning of April 1944. Owing to the joint efforts of my wife and her father and the </text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="543" height="13" font="5">pains taken by them to make every kind of provision for the two-day hilly journey, I reached Srinagar in my then </text>
<text top="197" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">extremely weak condition without mishap. There, surrounded by relatives and friends and nursed with assiduous care by</text>
<text top="210" left="9" width="548" height="13" font="5">my wife and daughter, I made rapid progress, gaining enough strength in a few months to resume my duties in the </text>
<text top="224" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">office. In the course of a year I grew hardy and strong, able to bear strain and fatigue, exertion and pressure, but I could </text>
<text top="238" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">not overcome the susceptibility of my system to digestive disorders in the event of unusual delay or irregularity in diet. I</text>
<text top="252" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">resumed my old habit of two meals a day, with a cup of milk and a slice of bread in the mornings and afternoons. By the</text>
<text top="266" left="9" width="539" height="13" font="5">end of the year my appetite became normal and the amount of food moderate, with a small measure of meat as a </text>
<text top="280" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">necessary ingredient. The lustrous appearance of external objects as well as of thought forms and the brilliance of dream</text>
<text top="294" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">images was intensified during the worst period of the last disorder and grew in brightness to such an extent that when </text>
<text top="308" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">gazing at a beautiful sunlit landscape I always felt as if I were looking at a heavenly scene transported to the earth from </text>
<text top="322" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">a distant elysium, illuminated by dancing beams of molten silver. This astounding feature of my consciousness, purely </text>
<text top="336" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">subjective of course, never exhibited any alteration, save that it gained in transparency, brilliance, and penetrative power</text>
<text top="350" left="9" width="473" height="13" font="5">with the passage of time and continues to clothe me and all I perceive in inexpressible lustre today.</text>
<text top="376" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">Years passed without bringing any new development in me to the surface. Whatever was happening was transpiring </text>
<text top="390" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">within, beyond my knowledge and away from the reach of my eyes. Failing to notice any other change in me except for </text>
<text top="404" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">the sea of lustre in which I lived, and sternly warned by the last awful episode to desist from invoking the supernatural </text>
<text top="418" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">again, I occupied myself fully with the world and its affairs in an attempt to lead a normal life. In 1946 in collaboration </text>
<text top="432" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">with a few friends and colleagues I started a movement for economic reform in all obligatory social functions in our </text>
<text top="446" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">community. I had become acutely conscious of the crushing load of misery and even infamy which a low-income family</text>
<text top="460" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">had to carry all its life, almost to the funeral pyre, for the transitory pleasure of excelling its neighbours in pomp and </text>
<text top="474" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">show, in the grandeur of a feast, in the richness of a dowry, or in other such items of social ceremonial, and wanted to </text>
<text top="487" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">create conditions that would make it possible for a man of modest means to escape the pillory which otherwise awaits </text>
<text top="501" left="9" width="541" height="13" font="5">him without injury to his self-respect or detriment to his position in society. We made the attempt, creating more </text>
<text top="515" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">enemies than friends, earning more censure than praise, and meeting more opposition than support, and finally had to </text>
<text top="529" left="9" width="30" height="13" font="5">desist.</text>
<text top="555" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">In the summer of 1947 my daughter was married in an unostentatious manner in conformity with our reform scheme, the</text>
<text top="569" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">credit for which went not to us, but to her husband, a struggling young lawyer, orphaned at an early age and left without </text>
<text top="583" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">resources, who refused tempting offers of rich dowries to marry the dowryless daughter of a poor man. The alliance was</text>
<text top="597" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">proposed to his elder brother by a friend while I was at Jammu, and all I had to do was signify my assent to it. In this </text>
<text top="611" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">way in my peculiar mental condition nature spared me the ordeal of having to hunt indefinitely for a match for one who </text>
<text top="625" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">out of filial loyalty was as keen as I was myself to ensure that my principles in regard to dowry were not violated in any </text>
<text top="639" left="9" width="23" height="13" font="5">way.</text>
<text top="665" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">In the autumn of the same year the peaceful valley of Kashmir was thrown into convulsions by a sudden raid from </text>
<text top="679" left="9" width="531" height="13" font="5">marauding hordes of frontier tribesmen, who, organized and led by trained martial talent, came down upon the </text>
<text top="693" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">defenceless Kashmiris, pillaging, raping, and killing indiscriminately, until almost the whole northern side of the valley </text>
<text top="707" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">shook with the lamentations of the bereaved and cries of the plundered and ravished. When the carnage was over and </text>
<text top="721" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">the invaders had retired after several scuffles with Indian forces, the members of our small band of enthusiasts, ready to </text>
<text top="735" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">devote their energies to a noble cause, threw themselves into the arduous task of providing relief to a large section of the</text>
<text top="749" left="9" width="79" height="13" font="5">ravaged victims.</text>
<text top="774" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">That winter because of stormy conditions in many of the border districts of the state, attended by wholesale massacres </text>
<text top="788" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">and rape, the offices did not move to Jammu, and I therefore continued to attend to my duties at Srinagar, oblivious to </text>
<text top="802" left="9" width="526" height="13" font="5">the horror of the situation in the all-absorbing mission of service to which we had devoted ourselves. Entirely </text>
<text top="816" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">preoccupied with the task, I could not leave Kashmir during the winter of 1948 either and had to apply for leave of </text>

<text top="3" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">absence to complete the enterprise undertaken at a time when our own fate hung in the balance. During this interval </text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">momentous changes occurred in the political framework of the State. The hereditary ruler had to abdicate to make room </text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">for a people's government. This great upheaval brought in its wake countless smaller upheavals, bringing new values in </text>
<text top="45" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">place of the old and new ways of thought and action. The old order changed, as has always happened, often without </text>
<text top="59" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">effecting side by side the needed change for the better in human nature which, forgetting soon the lesson taught by a </text>
<text top="73" left="9" width="412" height="13" font="5">revolution, acts again in a manner that makes another upheaval inevitable after a time.</text>
<text top="99" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">In November 1949 I again went to Jammu with the office. My wife chose to stay at Srinagar to look after the house and </text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">children. She had grown confident of my health and ability to look after myself in view of the endurance displayed by </text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">me during the past two years. My system had functioned so regularly that there had occurred not the slightest cause for </text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">any perturbation. On the other hand, I had found myself fully equal to and in fact took pleasure in the strenuous task of </text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">relieving the distress of hundreds of families taken by us upon ourselves, a mere handful of men without resources or </text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">influence, at a time of extreme tension and under rigorous conditions. I stayed at Jammu with an old friend who was </text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">good enough to place a room at my disposal. I was glad to accept his hospitality, offered with great cordiality and love, </text>
<text top="197" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">as it afforded me several facilities, especially the opportunity to be all to myself, absorbed in the contemplation of the </text>
<text top="210" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">luminous glow within which had begun to assume to some extent the enrapturing character of the vision perceived on </text>
<text top="224" left="9" width="145" height="13" font="5">the first day of the awakening.</text>
<text top="250" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">Profiting by the awful experience I had undergone previously, I made absolutely no attempt to meditate as before. What </text>
<text top="264" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">I did now was quite different. Without any effort and sometimes even without my knowing it, I sank deeper and deeper </text>
<text top="278" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">within myself, engulfed more and more by the lustrous conscious waves, which appeared to grow in size and extent the </text>
<text top="292" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">more I allowed myself to sink without resistance into the sea of consciousness in which I often found myself immersed. </text>
<text top="306" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">After about twelve years a curious transformation had occurred in the glowing circle of awareness around my head </text>
<text top="320" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">which made me constantly conscious of a subtle world of life stretching on all sides in which I breathed, walked, and </text>
<text top="334" left="9" width="527" height="13" font="5">acted without either in any way affecting its all-pervasive homogenous character or being affected by it in my </text>
<text top="348" left="9" width="543" height="13" font="5">day-to-day transactions in the world. Speaking more clearly, it seemed as if I were breathing, moving, and acting </text>
<text top="362" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">surrounded by an extremely subtle, viewless, conscious void, as we are surrounded by radio waves, with the difference </text>
<text top="376" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">that I do not perceive or feel the existence of the waves and am compelled to acknowledge their presence by the logic of </text>
<text top="390" left="9" width="546" height="13" font="5">certain facts; in this case I was made aware of the invisible medium by internal conditions, as if my own confined </text>
<text top="404" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">consciousness, transcending its limitations, were now in direct touch with its own substance on all sides, like a sentient </text>
<text top="418" left="9" width="496" height="13" font="5">dewdrop floating intact in an ocean of pure being without mingling with the surrounding mass of water.</text>
<text top="444" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">During the past months I had on a few occasions noticed this tendency of my mind to turn without encountering any </text>
<text top="458" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">barrier to its expansion within itself, extending more like a drop of oil spreading on the surface of water until, collecting </text>
<text top="472" left="9" width="515" height="13" font="5">myself with an effort, I came back to my normal state, itself more extensive by far than the original field of </text>
<text top="485" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">consciousness I had possessed before the awakening. I had not attached much importance to this phase, believing it to </text>
<text top="499" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">be an attempt of the mind to fall into reveries which, because of its luminous spaciousness, created the impression of </text>
<text top="513" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">further internal expansion without implying any additional change in my already peculiar mental condition. About a </text>
<text top="527" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">month after my arrival at Jammu I noticed that not only had this tendency become more marked and frequent, but the </text>
<text top="541" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">daily plunge into the depths of my lucent being was maturing into a great source of happiness and strength for me. The </text>
<text top="555" left="9" width="533" height="13" font="5">development was, however, so gradual and the change so imperceptible that I was led to believe that the whole </text>
<text top="569" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">occurrence was the outcome of the general improvement in my health due to the salubrious climate rather than to any </text>
<text top="583" left="9" width="153" height="13" font="5">new factor operating within me.</text>
<text top="609" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">Towards the third week of December I noticed that when returning from these prolonged spells of absorption which had </text>
<text top="623" left="9" width="542" height="13" font="5">now become a regular feature of my solitary hours, my mind usually dwelt on the lyrics of my favourite mystics. </text>
<text top="637" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">Without the least idea of trying my skill at poetic composition, when not in an absorbed mood, I made attempts at it, </text>
<text top="651" left="9" width="578" height="13" font="5">keeping the mystical rhymes which I liked most as models before me. Beyond the fact that I had committed to memory a</text>
<text top="665" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">few dozen Sanskrit verses culled from the scriptures and a few dozen couplets picked up from the works of mystics, I </text>
<text top="679" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">knew nothing of poetry. After a few days of mere playful dabbling I became restless, and for the first time in my life I </text>
<text top="693" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">felt an urge to write verse. Not at all impressed seriously by what I thought was a passing impulse, I put to paper a few </text>
<text top="707" left="9" width="253" height="13" font="5">stanzas, devoting several hours every day to the task.</text>
<text top="733" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">I wrote in Kashmiri, but after about a fortnight of daily endeavour I found I did not improve. The sterility of my efforts </text>
<text top="747" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">to write in verse, instead of dampening my spirits, urged me to greater efforts, however, and I devoted more and more </text>
<text top="760" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">time to what now became a regular, fascinating hobby for me. The standard of the compositions did not improve in the </text>
<text top="774" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">least, and I had often to labour for hours to complete a line and then longer to find another to match it. I never associated</text>
<text top="788" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">the new tendency with the mysterious agency at work in my body. But these unsuccessful attempts I was making at </text>
<text top="802" left="9" width="540" height="13" font="5">verse formation were a deliberately manoeuvered prelude to a startling occurrence soon after. I was being taught </text>
<text top="816" left="9" width="529" height="13" font="5">internally to exercise a newly developed talent in me about the existence of which I could have had no inkling </text>

<text top="3" left="9" width="341" height="13" font="5">otherwise; my crude attempts were the first indication of the schooling.</text>
<text top="29" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">During those days an ardent member of our small band of zealous workers in Kashmir was on visit to Jammu. She came </text>
<text top="43" left="9" width="537" height="13" font="5">often to my place, usually to have news of our work at Srinagar about which I received regular reports from our </text>
<text top="57" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">Treasurer or our Secretary. One day I offered to accompany her home when she rose to depart, intending by the long </text>
<text top="71" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">stroll to rid myself of a slight depression I felt at the time. We walked leisurely, discussing our work, when suddenly </text>
<text top="85" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">while crossing the Tawi Bridge I felt a mood of deep absorption settling upon me until I almost lost touch with my </text>
<text top="99" left="9" width="543" height="13" font="5">surroundings. I no longer heard the voice of my companion; she seemed to have receded into the distance though </text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">walking by my side. Near me, in a blaze of brilliant light, I suddenly felt what seemed to be a mighty conscious presence</text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">sprung from nowhere encompassing me and overshadowing all the objects around, from which two lines of a beautiful </text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">verse in Kashmiri poured out to float before my vision, like luminous writing in the air, disappearing as suddenly as they</text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="49" height="13" font="5">had come.</text>
<text top="181" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">When I came to myself, I found the girl looking at me in blank amazement, bewildered by my abrupt silence and the </text>
<text top="195" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">expression of utter detachment on my face. Without revealing to her all that had happened, I repeated the verse, saying </text>
<text top="208" left="9" width="514" height="13" font="5">that it had all of a sudden taken form in my mind in spite of myself, and that accounted for the break in our </text>
<text top="222" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">conversation. She listened in surprise, struck by the beauty of the rhyme, weighing every word, and then said that it was </text>
<text top="236" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">indeed nothing short of miraculous for one who had never been favoured by the muse before to compose so exquisite a </text>
<text top="250" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">verse on the very first attempt with such lightning rapidity. I heard her in silence, carried away by the profundity of the </text>
<text top="264" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">experience I had just gone through. Until that hour all I had experienced of the superconscious was purely subjective, </text>
<text top="278" left="9" width="545" height="13" font="5">neither demonstrable to nor verifiable by others. But now for the first time I had before me a tangible proof of the </text>
<text top="292" left="9" width="462" height="13" font="5">change that had occurred in me unintelligible to and independently of my surface consciousness.</text>

<text top="446" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">of course vast differences between the mysticism 'sacred' of our author and mysticism 'profane', by which, following </text>

<text top="554" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">Sacred mysticism recognizes the transformation of perception not as a separate visual experience, a kick or thrill, but as </text>
<text top="568" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">the outcome of a state of being. In alchemy this stage was referred to as the peacock's tail in which are 'eyes' unfurled </text>
<text top="582" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">amid some of the most royally blazing colours known in nature. The Stone too was known as the tincture, which stained</text>
<text top="596" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">and coloured any object it contacted. The return of vivid colour follows the white phase. Psychologically, it refers to the </text>
<text top="610" left="9" width="548" height="13" font="5">return of health and vitality, joy in life, love for existence, the liberation of feeling beyond the personal immediate </text>
<text top="624" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">surroundings, the extension of sensation beyond the senses to the spirit of nature itself; whereas the spiritual world </text>
<text top="638" left="9" width="522" height="13" font="5">moves out from its shadowy existence as only a mental phenomenon and takes on the colour of living reality.</text>
<text top="663" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">Even in alchemy this stage was followed by a new <i>mortificatio, </i>a new disintegration. There, it is difficult to tell why; </text>
<text top="677" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">here, we are given an insight. Our author, in his honesty, writes: 'I was overjoyed at the glorious possibility within <i>my </i></text>

<text top="705" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">Kundalini. It was only now that I could <i>grasp </i>the reason why ... <i>success ... </i>was thought to be the highest <i>achievement </i></text>
<text top="719" left="9" width="525" height="13" font="5">possible ... the <i>supreme prize attainable </i>at the end.' He compares accomplished yogis with 'mighty rulers and </text>
<text top="733" left="9" width="295" height="13" font="5">potentates'. It was an 'honour' that had been 'bestowed on me'.</text>
<text top="759" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">The next paragraph begins: 'But, alas, my good luck was exceedingly shortlived.' From my italics above, it becomes </text>
<text top="773" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">clear just why: he had fallen victim to a new inflation. Little wonder after that blaze that he did catch fire himself. So </text>
<text top="787" left="9" width="545" height="13" font="5">again an even worse purge, an even worse 'dying to everything' was necessary. (How necessary is suffering!) The </text>
<text top="801" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">peacock is also a symbol of vanity and pride; the tincture may stain the ego too, bringing to it the poisonous taint of </text>

<text top="3" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">The peculiar physical experiences belong to the <i>death experience, </i>and similar fits of jerking uncontrolled movements</text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">are reported in medieval accounts where these motions were attributed to a plague of devils. The experience is one of</text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="516" height="13" font="5">dismemberment, disintegration (attested to as well by the Shamans as an archetypal event in their process in</text>
<text top="45" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">individuation—see M. Eliade, <i>Shamanism, Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy). </i>Psychologically, the central system of will </text>
<text top="59" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">which has the ego as its core falls apart into autonomous complexes. One is no longer in control of oneself, and the </text>
<text top="73" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">autonomic nervous system dominates the habitual system identified with the conscious will. One is indeed a victim of </text>
<text top="87" left="9" width="396" height="13" font="5">unconscious energetic centres, those devilish complexes, pulling every which way.</text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="527" height="13" font="5">We cannot help but be enormously impressed with the overwhelming physical reality of Gopi Krishna's death </text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">experience. It confirms what I have tried to write about in my <i>Suicide and the Soul, </i>that only if the experience be totally</text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">convincing, totally 'real', can a convincingly real rebirth follow. Much as we may know this in advance, it is each time a</text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="494" height="13" font="5">terrifyingly threatening event—and it must be so, otherwise it would not carry the conviction of reality.</text>
<text top="181" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">I am also enormously impressed that our author was saved by a dream, and such a simple one: a dish of <i>meat. </i>When he </text>
<text top="195" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">was first urged by an impulse to eat meat he disregarded the unconscious suggestion perhaps on doctrinaire grounds, </text>
<text top="208" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">still convinced that his mild diet was the right one and that his appetite was a sign of greed (whereas his true 'greed' was </text>
<text top="222" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">spiritual, as our italicized passages above show). This often happens in an analysis: the unconscious urges a step, an </text>
<text top="236" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">advance into health, which the conscious personality, still used to the limits of its neurosis, feels hesitant to make. But a </text>
<text top="250" left="9" width="367" height="13" font="5">forward step not taken when the time is there is the same as a step backward.</text>
<text top="276" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">What does this meat mean? Is not meat a return to the human condition in its animal reality, the life of the blood, the </text>
<text top="290" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">instinct of involvement (hunting, struggling, killing)? Meat is the food of the hunter, warrior, chieftain. In alchemy it </text>
<text top="304" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">would belong to the symbols of the rubedo, the red king, of masculine emotional strength. It is also the final integration </text>
<text top="318" left="9" width="205" height="13" font="5">of the mother complex, eating her as body.</text>
<text top="344" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">Subsequent to the acceptance of meat, Gopi Krishna returns to the world of action, as a 'chieftain', having organized a</text>
<text top="358" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">group for social work. He is thoroughly involved, not only with paper and ink as in his government office, but now on</text>
<text top="372" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">the plane of daily suffering—widows, refugees, war. The time of the <i>return </i>is traditionally critical. After the 'great </text>
<text top="386" left="9" width="548" height="13" font="5">liberation' how does one re-enter daily life? After such experiences how does one transfer the love and beauty and </text>
<text top="400" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">meaning to the other hours of the week? How does one bridge the gap between planes of being? If it is a narrow gate, an</text>
<text top="414" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">impossibly dangerous passage to cross the threshold into the releasing other world, how much more difficult to re-enter </text>
<text top="428" left="9" width="545" height="13" font="5">this known and confining world with all its pettiness and banal sorrows. For our author, the 'return' seems to have </text>
<text top="442" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">occurred quite naturally. (Of course, in one sense he did throughout keep one foot well planted in this world with job, </text>
<text top="456" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">family, and diet.) His crisis was less an externalized one: 'How do I enter society and the world of fellow-man bringing </text>
<text top="469" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">with me the gifts that I have been given?' His crisis came before, symbolized by the meat. Once that was eaten, his </text>
<text top="483" left="9" width="319" height="13" font="5">appetite 'returned' and with it re-entry into the world in a new way.</text>
<text top="509" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">The natural and easy flow back into the world, spreading himself thin over the troubled waters of social reality, to calm,</text>
<text top="523" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">soothe, bind up, again has a striking resemblance to one of the last stages of alchemy. I refer to the image of 'oil'. He</text>
<text top="537" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">describes his expansion of consciousness to extend 'more and more like a drop of oil spreading on the surface of water'.</text>
<text top="551" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">The Stone was said to have an oily nature, easily melted but not to be evaporated, staining (as a tincture) all with which</text>
<text top="565" left="9" width="539" height="13" font="5">it came in contact. 'The development was gradual and the change so imperceptible' that he attributed it to general</text>
<text top="579" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">improvement rather than to a new principle at work. But just this imperceptible peaceful oozing rather than willing, this</text>
<text top="593" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">softening of friction rather than striving, this thick slowness which is yet lighter than water, is attached to it yet floats</text>
<text top="607" left="9" width="414" height="13" font="5">over it— just this is the fat and oil of abundance, the joy and compassion of full being.</text>

<text top="705" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">AFTER escorting my companion to her destination I returned to my residence in time for dinner. All the way back in the</text>
<text top="719" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">stillness of a pleasant evening and the welcome solitude of an unfrequented path I remained deeply engrossed in the </text>
<text top="733" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">enigma presented by the vision and the sudden leap taken by my mind in a new direction. The more intently I examined </text>
<text top="747" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">the problem the more surprised I became at the deep meaning of the production, the exquisite formation, and the highly </text>

<text top="801" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">I reached my place while still deeply absorbed in the same train of thought and, still engrossed, sat down for dinner. I </text>

<text top="31" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">consciously being aware of them. In the middle of the meal, while still in the same condition of semi-entrancement, I </text>
<text top="45" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">stopped abruptly, contemplating with awe and amazement, which made the hair on my skin stand on end, a marvellous </text>
<text top="59" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">phenomenon in progress in the depths of my being. Without any effort on my part and while seated comfortably on a </text>
<text top="73" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">chair, I had gradually passed off, without becoming aware of it, into a condition of exaltation and self-expansion similar </text>
<text top="87" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">to that which I had experienced on the very first occasion, in December 1937, with the modification that in place of a </text>
<text top="101" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">roaring noise in my ears there was now a cadence like the humming of a swarm of bees, enchanting and melodious, and </text>
<text top="115" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">the encircling glow was replaced by a penetrating silvery radiance, already a feature of my being within and without.</text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">The marvellous aspect of the condition, lay in the sudden realization that although linked to the body and surroundings I</text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">had expanded in an indescribable manner into a titanic personality, conscious from within of an immediate and direct </text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">contact with an intensely conscious universe, a wonderful inexpressible immanence all around me. My body, the chair I </text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">was sitting on, the table in front of me, the room enclosed by walls, the lawn outside and the space beyond including the</text>
<text top="197" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">earth and sky appeared to be most amazingly mere phantoms in this real, interpenetrating and all-pervasive ocean of </text>
<text top="210" left="9" width="536" height="13" font="5">existence which, to explain the most incredible part of it as best I can, seemed to be simultaneously unbounded, </text>
<text top="224" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">stretching out immeasurably in all directions, and yet no bigger than an infinitely small point. From this marvellous </text>
<text top="238" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">point the entire existence, of which my body and its surroundings were a part, poured out like radiation, as if a reflection</text>
<text top="252" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">as vast as my conception of the cosmos were thrown out upon infinity by a projector no bigger than a pinpoint, the </text>

<text top="280" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">consciousness in which I was now immersed appeared infinitely large and infinitely small at the same time, large when </text>
<text top="294" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">considered in relation to the world picture floating in it and small when considered in itself, measureless, without form </text>

<text top="334" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">It was an amazing and staggering experience for which I can cite no parallel and no simile, an experience beyond all and</text>
<text top="348" left="9" width="533" height="13" font="5">everything belonging to this world, conceivable by the mind or perceptible to the senses. I was intensely aware </text>
<text top="362" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">internally of a marvellous being so concentratedly and massively conscious as to outlustre and outstature infinitely the </text>

<text top="460" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">circumscribed by the body, grown to the spacious dimensions of a mighty universe and the exalted stature of a majestic </text>
<text top="474" left="9" width="528" height="13" font="5">immanence before which the material cosmos shrank to the subordinate position of an evanescent and illusive </text>
<text top="487" left="9" width="54" height="13" font="5">appendage.</text>
<text top="513" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">I awoke from the semi-trance condition after about a half-hour, affected to the roots of my being by the majesty and </text>
<text top="527" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">marvel of the vision, entirely oblivious to the passage of time, having in the intensity of the experience lived a life of </text>
<text top="541" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">ordinary existence. During the period, probably due to fluctuations in the state of my body and mind caused by internal </text>
<text top="555" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">and external stimuli, there were intervals of deeper and lesser penetration not distinguishable by the flow of time but by </text>
<text top="569" left="9" width="535" height="13" font="5">the state of immanence, which at the point of the deepest penetration assumed such an awe-inspiring, almighty, </text>
<text top="583" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">all-knowing, blissful, and at the same time absolutely motionless, intangible, and formless character that the invisible </text>
<text top="597" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">line demarcating the material world and the boundless, all-conscious Reality ceased to exist, the two fusing into one; the</text>
<text top="611" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">mighty ocean sucked up by a drop, the enormous three-dimensional universe swallowed by a grain of sand, the entire </text>
<text top="625" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">creation, the knower and the known, the seer and the seen, reduced to an inexpressible sizeless void which no mind can </text>
<text top="639" left="9" width="173" height="13" font="5">conceive nor any language describe.</text>
<text top="665" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">Before coming out completely from this condition, and before the glory in which I found myself had completely faded, I</text>
<text top="679" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">found floating in the luminous glow of my mind the rhymes following the couplet that had suddenly taken shape in me </text>
<text top="693" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">near the Tawi Bridge that day. The lines occurred one after the other, as if dropped into the three-dimensional field of </text>
<text top="707" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">my consciousness by another source of condensed knowledge within me. They started from the glowing recesses of my </text>
<text top="721" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">being, developing suddenly into fully formed couplets like falling snowflakes which, from tiny specks high up, become </text>
<text top="735" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">clear-cut, regularly shaped crystals when nearing the eye, and vanished so suddenly as to leave me hardly any time to </text>
<text top="749" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">retain them in my memory. They came fully formed, complete with language, rhyme, and metre, finished products </text>
<text top="762" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">originating as it seemed from the surrounding intelligence to pass before my internal eye for expression. I was still in an </text>
<text top="776" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">elevated state when I rose from the table and went to my room. The first thing I did was to write down the lines as far as </text>
<text top="790" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">I could remember them. It was not an easy task. I found that during the short interval that had elapsed I had forgotten </text>
<text top="804" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">not only the order in which the rhymes had occurred but also whole portions of the matter, which it was extremely </text>
<text top="818" left="9" width="452" height="13" font="5">difficult for me to recollect or supply. It took me more than two hours to supply the omissions.</text>

<text top="3" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">I went to bed that night in an excited and happy frame of mind. After years of acute suffering I had at last been given a </text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="539" height="13" font="5">glimpse into the supersensible and at the same time made the fortunate recipient of divine grace, which all fitted </text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">admirably with the traditional concepts of Kundalini. I could not believe in my good luck; I felt it was too astounding to </text>
<text top="45" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">be true. But when I looked within myself to find out what I had done to deserve it, I felt extremely humbled. I had to my</text>
<text top="59" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">credit no achievement remarkable enough to entitle me to the honour bestowed on me. I had lived an ordinary life, never</text>
<text top="73" left="9" width="501" height="13" font="5">done anything exceptionally meritorious and never achieved a complete subdual of desires and appetites.</text>
<text top="99" left="9" width="548" height="13" font="5">I reviewed all the noteworthy incidents of the last twelve years in my mind, studying them in the light of the latest </text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="534" height="13" font="5">development, and found that much of what had been dark and obscure so far was assuming a deep and startling </text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">significance. In the intensity of joy which I felt at the revelation I forgot the terrible ordeal I had passed through as also </text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">the gruelling suspense and anxiety that had been my companions for all the period. I had drunk the cup of suffering to </text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">the dregs to come upon a resplendent, never-ending source of unutterable joy and peace lying hidden in my interior, </text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">waiting for a favourable opportunity to reveal itself, affording me in one instant a deeper insight into the essence of </text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="241" height="13" font="5">things than a whole life devoted to study could do.</text>
<text top="208" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">Thinking such thoughts I fell asleep at last, waking again in the luminous realm of dreams in which I had my abode </text>
<text top="222" left="9" width="536" height="13" font="5">every night. When I awoke in the morning the first recollection that came to my mind was of the transcendental </text>
<text top="236" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">experience of the previous evening. Even the fleeting memory of a superconscious flight into the wonderland of Infinity </text>
<text top="250" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">is transporting, surpassing anything we can think of or encounter in the physical world. Considering the stupendous </text>
<text top="264" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">nature of the vision it is no wonder that the ancient seers of India in constant communion with the transcendental reality </text>
<text top="278" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">regarded the world as no more than an inexplicable shadow, an impermanent, illusory appearance before an eternal, </text>
<text top="292" left="9" width="271" height="13" font="5">resplendent sun of indescribable grandeur and sublimity.</text>
<text top="318" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">Every day during the next two weeks I wrote a few stanzas in Kashmiri that without exception dealt with some aspect of</text>
<text top="332" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">the unknown; some of them were definitely apocalyptic in nature. The verses occurred suddenly at odd times in the day </text>
<text top="346" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">or night, preceded by a voluntary pause on my part in the normal process of thinking. This preliminary cessation of </text>
<text top="360" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">mental activity was soon followed by a state of deep absorption, as if I were diving within myself to reach a certain </text>
<text top="374" left="9" width="543" height="13" font="5">depth where I could catch the vibrations of the message always expressed in poetry. The lines developed from an </text>
<text top="388" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">extremely subtle form, an invisible seed, and instantaneously passed before my mind as fully formed verses, following </text>
<text top="402" left="9" width="533" height="13" font="5">each other in rapid succession until the whole passage was completed, when I suddenly experienced a desire to </text>
<text top="416" left="9" width="372" height="13" font="5">withdraw myself from the state of semi-entrancement and return to normality.</text>
<text top="442" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">On one more occasion during that fortnight I had the same transcendental experience as on the first day, tallying in </text>
<text top="456" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">almost all respects with the original one. I was sitting on a chair reading a piece written on the preceding day when, </text>
<text top="469" left="9" width="110" height="13" font="5">noticing the command,</text>
<text top="495" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">I leaned back in the chair and closed my eyes in a mood of relaxation, waiting for the results. The moment I did so I felt </text>
<text top="509" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">myself expanding in all directions, oblivious to the surroundings, and enveloped in an immense sea of glowing radiance,</text>
<text top="523" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">entertained by a sweet internal cadence unlike any symphony heard on earth, drawing nearer to the supreme condition, </text>
<text top="537" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">until with a plunge I found myself detached from all belonging to the causal world, lost in the inexpressible void, a </text>
<text top="551" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">marvellous state of being absolutely devoid of spatial and temporal distinctions. I returned to my normal state after more</text>
<text top="565" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">than half an hour and during the few moments of transition found a beautiful composition waiting for cognizance by my</text>
<text top="579" left="9" width="371" height="13" font="5">mind, staggered by the extraordinary experience that it had just gone through.</text>
<text top="605" left="9" width="530" height="13" font="5">After a fortnight the language changed and instead of rhymes in Kashmiri they occurred in English. The slight </text>
<text top="619" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">knowledge of English verse which I possessed was all confined to the study of a few selected poems forming a part of </text>
<text top="633" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">my school and college texts. Beyond that, having no inherent taste for poetry, I had never cared to read it. But I could </text>
<text top="647" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">easily perceive that the passage before me was similar to the poems I had read, but having no knowledge of the rhyme </text>
<text top="661" left="9" width="386" height="13" font="5">and metre of English poetry, I could not form any judgment about its excellence.</text>
<text top="687" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">A few days after, the poems appeared in Urdu instead of in English. Having a workable knowledge of the former, I did </text>
<text top="701" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">not feel any difficulty in writing down the lines, but all the same many blanks were left which were filled only months </text>
<text top="715" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">later. Urdu was succeeded by Punjabi in a few days. I had not read any book in Punjabi but had learned the language by </text>
<text top="729" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">constant contact with Punjabi-speaking friends and associates during my several years' stay in Lahore as a school and </text>
<text top="743" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">college student. My surprise, however, knew no bounds when a few days later the direction came that I should prepare </text>
<text top="756" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">to receive verses in Persian. I had never read the language nor could I in the least understand or speak it. I waited in </text>
<text top="770" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">breathless expectancy and immediately after the signal a few Persian verses flashed before my mind in the same manner </text>
<text top="784" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">as the compositions in other languages. I had no difficulty in recognizing many Persian words and even the verse form </text>
<text top="798" left="9" width="526" height="13" font="5">of the lines. Kashmiri being rich in Persian words, it was easy for me to understand words already used in my </text>
<text top="812" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">mother-tongue. After a great deal of exertion and straining, I at last succeeded in penning down the lines, but there were </text>
</page>
<page number="75" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="842" width="595">
<text top="3" left="9" width="392" height="13" font="5">many blanks and mistakes which could not be filled in or set right until long after.</text>
<text top="29" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">The few short poems in Persian that I was able to jot down involved such a strenuous effort that after some days I was </text>
<text top="43" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">obliged to desist from the onerous task. I felt entirely exhausted and what was more serious, the unhealthy effect of the </text>
<text top="57" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">exertion and excitement elicited was becoming seriously apparent in the prolonged spells of restlessness preceding my </text>
<text top="71" left="9" width="339" height="13" font="5">sleep. Consequently I gave myself complete rest for more than a week.</text>
<text top="97" left="9" width="578" height="13" font="5">After a short rest, feeling somewhat restored to health, I no longer felt it necessary to resist the impulse and submitted to </text>
<text top="111" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">the elevating moods at opportune times. One day when I had obeyed the unspoken direction for relaxing my mind to </text>
<text top="125" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">prepare myself for reception and had sunk deeply enough to reach the subtle emanations from the amazing conscious </text>
<text top="139" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">source within, yet tantalizingly out of my reach, I felt a thrill of deep excitement not unmixed with fear pass through </text>
<text top="153" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">every fibre of my being when the signal flashed across my now quiescent mind to make myself ready for taking down a </text>
<text top="167" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">piece in German. I came back from the semi-trance condition with a ferment in my mind, unable to reconcile myself to </text>
<text top="181" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">the idea that such a weird performance could ever be possible. I had never learned German, nor seen a book written in </text>
<text top="195" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">the language, nor to the best of my knowledge ever heard it spoken in my presence, and yet I was expected to write </text>
<text top="208" left="9" width="543" height="13" font="5">down a poem in it which in plain terms meant a complete negation of the time-honoured truth that language is an </text>
<text top="222" left="9" width="182" height="13" font="5">acquired and not inherited possession.</text>
<text top="248" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">German was followed by French and Italian. Then came a few verses in Sanskrit followed by Arabic. Surely there could</text>
<text top="262" left="9" width="544" height="13" font="5">be nothing more convincing than the phenomena I had witnessed during the previous few weeks to bring the idea </text>
<text top="276" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">irresistibly home to me that I was in occasional contact with an inexpressible fount of all knowledge and that but for my </text>
<text top="290" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">inability to understand and transcribe, I could take down poetic pieces in most of the wellknown languages of the earth. </text>
<text top="304" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">I felt wave after wave of conscious electricity pass through me replete with knowledge to which, because of the poor </text>
<text top="318" left="9" width="238" height="13" font="5">capacity of my brain, I could not have full access.</text>
<text top="344" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">Language fails me when I attempt to describe the experience which off and on has all along since then been the most </text>
<text top="358" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">sublime and the most elevating feature of my existence. On every such occasion I am made to feel as if the observer in </text>
<text top="372" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">me, or speaking more precisely, my lustrous conscious self, is floating, with but an extremely dim idea of the corporeal </text>
<text top="386" left="9" width="535" height="13" font="5">frame in a vividly bright conscious plane, every fragment of which represents a boundless world of knowledge, </text>
<text top="400" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">embracing the present, past, and future, commanding all the sciences, philosophies, and arts ever known or that will be </text>
<text top="414" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">known in the ages to come, all concentrated and contained in a point existing here and everywhere, now and always, a </text>
<text top="428" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">formless, measureless ocean of wisdom from which, drop by drop, knowledge has filtered and will continue to filter into</text>
<text top="442" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">the human brain. On every visit to the supersensible realm I am so overwhelmed by the mystery and the wonder of it </text>
<text top="456" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">that everything else of this world, everything conceived by us of the next, every fact and incident of my life save this, </text>
<text top="469" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">every momentous event of history, every ambition and desire, and above all even my own existence, life and death, </text>
<text top="483" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">appear to be trite and trivial before the indescribable glory, the unfathomable mystery, and the unimaginable extent of </text>
<text top="497" left="9" width="404" height="13" font="5">the marvellous ocean of life, of which I am at times permitted to approach the shore.</text>
<text top="563" left="9" width="135" height="20" font="3">Chapter Seventeen</text>
<text top="596" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">THE daily dive into the conscious ocean to which I had now unexpectedly found access had a most exhilarating effect </text>
<text top="610" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">on my mind. I was overwhelmed with wonder at the incalculable wealth I had found within myself. The distracting </text>
<text top="624" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">anxiety I had felt and the grave doubts I had entertained about my condition vanished altogether, yielding place to a </text>
<text top="638" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">feeling of inexpressible thankfulness to the divine power, which in spite of my ignorance, constant resistance, many </text>
<text top="652" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">faults, frailties, and mistakes, had wrought with matchless skill a new channel of perception in me, a new and more </text>
<text top="665" left="9" width="326" height="13" font="5">penetrating sight in order to introduce me to a stupendous existence.</text>
<text top="691" left="9" width="537" height="13" font="5">In spite of all my efforts, the news of the strange psychic manifestations in me leaked out. My host, friends, and </text>
<text top="705" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">colleagues at the office were struck by my altered behaviour and my constant mood of deep absorption. Even if I had </text>
<text top="719" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">tried, I could not have shaken it off, being myself entirely carried away by the wonder of an occurrence beyond anything</text>
<text top="733" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">I could have imagined. I certainly could not hide from my close associates a development that had the effect of startling </text>
<text top="747" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">me out of my equilibrium. My host, uneasy at my constant perambulations in a state of deep abstraction, almost to the </text>
<text top="761" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">point of being totally oblivious at times, grew positively alarmed at seeing my lights on at odd hours in the night and </text>
<text top="775" left="9" width="288" height="13" font="5">finding me awake, writing in a mood of utter preoccupation.</text>
<text top="801" left="9" width="546" height="13" font="5">Knowing of my mystical tendencies, he remonstrated with me gently under the misapprehension that my constant </text>
<text top="815" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">absorption and nocturnal exertions were a prelude to a complete renunciation of the world in order to take up a monastic</text>

<text top="3" left="9" width="19" height="13" font="5">life.</text>
<text top="29" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">In the course of a few weeks, unable to resist the fascination of the newly found subliminal existence, I found myself </text>
<text top="43" left="9" width="535" height="13" font="5">powerless to come out of my contemplative moods. Except for a few hours of irregular sleep at night they were </text>
<text top="57" left="9" width="543" height="13" font="5">continuously upon me for the whole day, making it almost impossible for me to apply my mind to anything. I ate </text>
<text top="71" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">mechanically, almost as a child does in sleep, and when obliged to speak talked and heard like a man who is engrossed </text>
<text top="85" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">in watching a most fascinating drama enacted before him and returns laconic answers to the comments of those seated </text>
<text top="99" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">beside him, often without comprehending and remembering fully what is said. I went to the office more by force of </text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">habit than by choice or inclination. My whole being rose in revolt when I attempted to climb down from the ethereal </text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">heights of transcendence to the dry files lying unattended on my table. After some days the mere act of sitting in the </text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">cramped atmosphere of the room for hours became so unpleasant and oppressive that I proceeded on long leave, never </text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">to enter the premises again. I realized that the severance of my connection with the office would reduce my income to a </text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="543" height="13" font="5">great extent, but the urge in me to liberate myself from the bonds of servitude was too strong to be suppressed by </text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="170" height="13" font="5">monetary or wordly considerations.</text>
<text top="208" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">In the meantime the strange news travelled through the town, and crowds of people called at my residence, attracted by </text>
<text top="222" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">the rumours of the miraculous development in me. Most of them came merely to satisfy their curiosity and to verify </text>
<text top="236" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">what they had heard, much as they would have gone to look at a freak or to watch the astounding performance of a </text>
<text top="250" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">conjurer. But few of them evinced any interest in the genesis of the change or the reason for the sudden manifestation. </text>
<text top="264" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">In a few days the rush of people became so great and continuous that from early morning to the hour of darkness I had </text>
<text top="278" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">not a moment to myself. Feeling that it would be discourteous to refuse interviews, and labouring under the notion that </text>
<text top="292" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">such an attitude on my part would be misconstrued as pride, I bore the daily rush patiently at the cost of my mental </text>
<text top="306" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">peace, which ought to have been my primary concern in the initial stages of the new development. I was usually in an </text>
<text top="320" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">exalted state of mind throughout, and in the same condition talked to the people gathered round me, frequently passing </text>
<text top="334" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">into deeper moods under their looks from which I was often recalled to my surroundings by the entry of other groups. I </text>
<text top="348" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">greeted the eager crowds mechanically, barely mindful of what I said or of those who arrived and left during the day.</text>
<text top="374" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">After a few days the strain became unbearable, and I began to feel its adverse effects on my health. The first indication </text>
<text top="388" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">of the trouble was a growing restlessness during nights, which soon assumed the state of partial insomnia. Instead of </text>
<text top="402" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">feeling alarmed at the reappearance of an enemy that had caused me so much agony in the past, I interpreted it as first </text>
<text top="416" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">sign of a liberated existence, of freedom from the domination of the flesh, considered to be an essential feature of true </text>
<text top="430" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">spiritual growth. Lacking the care of my wife, who with a woman's true instinct always exercised a strict supervision of </text>
<text top="444" left="9" width="545" height="13" font="5">my diet, I grew indifferent to food also, revelling in the thought that I had at last overcome a weakness which had </text>
<text top="458" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">compelled me to be too attentive to my nutrition and a slave to regularity. Gradually a feeling of detachment from the </text>
<text top="472" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">world began to take hold of me, accompanied by an increasing desire to break the chains that bound me to my family </text>
<text top="485" left="9" width="462" height="13" font="5">and to lead the life of a sanyasi untroubled by desire and unfettered by customs and conventions.</text>
<text top="511" left="9" width="518" height="13" font="5">I had passed through a most strange experience which had culminated in a development entirely beyond my </text>
<text top="525" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">expectations and one which it was necessary to make known to others. It was therefore my duty, I argued with myself, </text>
<text top="539" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">to lead a life entirely free of the fret and fever of a worldly existence, devoted exclusively to the service of mankind, </text>
<text top="553" left="9" width="540" height="13" font="5">with the object of making known the great truth I had found. The only obstacle to the execution of this resolve, I </text>
<text top="567" left="9" width="541" height="13" font="5">thought, would be presented by the strong ties of affection which bound me to my family and friends and which, </text>
<text top="581" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">judging from my own past experience and inherent tendencies, would be very hard to break. But when I pondered more </text>
<text top="595" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">deeply on the issue and searched my heart for the answer, I found to my great surprise that the amazing experience I had</text>
<text top="609" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">now undergone had purged me clean of wordly love also, and that I could part from my family and friends forever </text>
<text top="623" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">without so much as a single look behind, to perform unhampered by any thought of family obligations the sacred task I </text>
<text top="637" left="9" width="172" height="13" font="5">eagerly wished to take upon myself.</text>
<text top="663" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">But though I was afforded a glimpse into the state of mind and the motive power behind it that drove the prophets and </text>
<text top="677" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">seers of old to unparalleled feats of renunciation and asceticism, which appear beyond the capacity of the ordinary man, </text>
<text top="691" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">I was not destined to follow in their footsteps due to the extreme susceptibility of my system to disorder under the stress </text>
<text top="705" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">of unfavourable and rough conditions. There was a weak spot in me somewhere which often gave way under the rigour </text>
<text top="719" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">imposed by an ascetic way of life or continued irregularity in the matter of diet and sleep. I believe it is because of this </text>
<text top="733" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">vulnerability that I was able to trace the close connection existing between the body and the mind even in transcendental</text>
<text top="747" left="9" width="416" height="13" font="5">conditions of the brain which might not have been so clearly apparent to me otherwise.</text>
<text top="772" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">For more than a month I lived in a state of triumph and spiritual exaltation which it is impossible to describe. During all </text>
<text top="786" left="9" width="535" height="13" font="5">this period my whole being was always pervaded by a distinct feeling that while moving, sitting or acting I was </text>
<text top="800" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">constantly encompassed by a stupendous silent presence from which I drew my individual existence. Frequently I had </text>
<text top="814" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">moods of deeper absorption when, speechless with wonder, I lost myself completely in the indescribable. These moods </text>

<text top="3" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">were attended occasionally by inspirational flashes towards the close. After the end of this period, owing to insufficient </text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">sleep and irregularity in diet, the feeling of exaltation and happiness, which had been present continuously, diminished </text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">perceptibly, and I again began to feel signs of exhaustion and at times even of uneasiness in my mind. I was roughly </text>
<text top="45" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">shaken out of this short-lived state of heavenly joy when one morning, rising from bed after a restless night, I found </text>
<text top="59" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">myself in the grip of acute depression which continued for the whole day, acting like a dip in ice-cold water on one in a </text>
<text top="73" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">state of inebriation. Startled out of my mistaken optimism and reprimanding myself sharply for the neglect, I forced </text>
<text top="87" left="9" width="546" height="13" font="5">myself to give immediate attention to my diet, and after some days noticed signs of improvement in my condition.</text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">But my immoderate indulgence in psychic enjoyment, excessive mental exertion, and neglect of organic needs had, </text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">without my detecting it, depleted my vitality to an alarming extent, creating a poisoned state of the nervous system, </text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">which prevented me from noticing the extremely slow deterioration, in time to take appropriate precautionary measures. </text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">I had heard stories of men who, intoxicated with joy to the point of madness on their first glimpse of the supersensory </text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">state of existence after the awakening, had been so entirely carried away from earthly life that they found it impossible </text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">to come down to the normal level of consciousness in order to attend to the needs of the body; their spirits in unbroken </text>
<text top="197" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">ecstatic contemplation of the fascinating super-sensual realm from the beginning to the end had departed the starved </text>
<text top="210" left="9" width="239" height="13" font="5">body without even once descending back to earth.</text>
<text top="236" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">I immediately refrained from exhibiting myself before the curious crowds that came and went in an unending stream. </text>
<text top="250" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">Instead of encouraging the moods of intense absorption, always ready to settle upon me the moment my mind turned </text>
<text top="264" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">inwards, I deliberately avoided introversion, devoting myself exclusively to wordly trifles in order to allow a period of </text>
<text top="278" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">rest to the already over-stimulated brain. It was about the middle of March, marking the beginning of spring in Kashmir,</text>
<text top="292" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">and I felt I should no longer delay returning to my home, my only asylum in times of distress, in order to submit myself </text>
<text top="306" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">to the affectionate care of my wife, my sole guardian during illness. Without losing a single day I journeyed to Srinagar </text>
<text top="320" left="9" width="535" height="13" font="5">by air, relinquishing forever the thought of roaming the earth in the traditional way to effect the regeneration of </text>
<text top="334" left="9" width="523" height="13" font="5">mankind, a fantasy in my case born from the desire for power, the yearning for mental conquest, which often </text>
<text top="348" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">accompanies the activity of Kundalini in the intellectual centre, causing a slightly intoxicated condition of the brain too </text>
<text top="362" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">subtle to be noticed by the subject himself or by his uninformed companions, however erudite and intelligent they may </text>
<text top="376" left="9" width="14" height="13" font="5">be.</text>
<text top="402" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">At home I entrusted myself completely to the care of my wife, who from the absence of colour in my face and the look </text>
<text top="416" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">in my eyes, at once concluded that I was in a state of exhaustion and stood in urgent need of rest and recuperation. The </text>
<text top="430" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">news of my strange feats had travelled to Srinagar before me, and it became a difficult problem to prevent the crowds </text>
<text top="444" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">which assembled at my house from gaining access to me. After a few days I was able to devote several hours daily to </text>
<text top="458" left="9" width="546" height="13" font="5">meet the visitors without fatigue, and kept myself lightly engaged for the rest of the time to avoid the influence of </text>
<text top="472" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">contemplative moods which even now exercised such a fascination over me that I had to exert my will to the utmost to </text>
<text top="485" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">resist the temptation completely for even a day. In the course of a few weeks the crowds began to thin and ultimately </text>
<text top="499" left="9" width="533" height="13" font="5">ceased, allowing me more respite which coupled with the precautions taken in diet, helped me to overcome the </text>
<text top="513" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">deficiency caused by my own lack of restraint. But it took more than six months for me to be normal again and to attend</text>
<text top="527" left="9" width="498" height="13" font="5">my duties without losing myself all of a sudden in the rapt contemplation of an unconditioned existence.</text>
<text top="553" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">By the time my leave expired I had made up my mind not to serve any longer. The way of escape from the sordidness </text>
<text top="567" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">and misery of the material world into the unutterable peace and tranquillity of the effulgent internal universe was too </text>
<text top="581" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">narrow and too risky to allow me to make use of it with a heavy load of wordly responsibilities upon my shoulders. In </text>
<text top="595" left="9" width="581" height="13" font="5">order to taste the fruit of true spiritual liberation, it was necessary for me to free myself as far as possible from the chains </text>
<text top="609" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">that bound me to the material world. The secluded corner of a busy office room, throbbing with noiseless activity and </text>
<text top="623" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">tense with subdued excitement was not a place where a man now constantly preoccupied with the unseen, could pass </text>
<text top="637" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">several hours at a stretch always at the call of others, without running the risk of serious injury to his mental health. </text>
<text top="651" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">There were other reasons too, which precipitated my decision to sever my connections entirely with the office. The </text>
<text top="665" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">change of Government had brought in its wake a host of burning problems all demanding immediate solution. They had </text>
<text top="679" left="9" width="542" height="13" font="5">to be handled, and handled carefully at a time when the whole country was in a state of ferment caused by a wild </text>
<text top="693" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">scramble for power and possessions on the one side and the efforts made to avert deprivation and dispossession on the </text>
<text top="707" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">other. Our office could not escape the general commotion visible everywhere, and soon its atmosphere grew charged </text>
<text top="721" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">with mutual suspicion to an extent that for a man in my condition it was positively dangerous. Accordingly I applied for </text>
<text top="735" left="9" width="391" height="13" font="5">premature retirement which, after the usual formalities was ultimately sanctioned.</text>
<text top="760" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">I was now free to pass my time as I pleased, untroubled by any thoughts of how to find my way out of the ever-present </text>
<text top="774" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">official dilemmas and the constant conflicts between my conscience and the wishes of my superiors. After an absence of</text>
<text top="788" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">many months, during which there had literally occurred a world of difference in me, I again joined the staunch group of </text>
<text top="802" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">friends who had kept our movement alive during the interval. I again participated in their activities, which were now </text>
<text top="816" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">directed towards providing amenities for the utterly destitute widows in our society or towards removing the barrier of </text>
</page>
<page number="78" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="842" width="595">
<text top="3" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">public opinion against the remarriage of those of them who were agreeable to it, in this way mitigating to some extent </text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="523" height="13" font="5">the suffering of many subjected to inhuman treatment in the name of religion and caste by their own families.</text>
<text top="43" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">In spite of the deep desire of every member of the little group to confine their activities to the mission of service, they </text>
<text top="57" left="9" width="547" height="13" font="5">were drawn unwillingly into the troubled waters of political rivalry and ambition by constant opposition, aimed at </text>
<text top="71" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">forcing their allegiance. In the course of a few years it was made difficult for them even to carry on the humanitarian </text>
<text top="85" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">work in which they were engaged. But determined to persist they managed to continue their activities in a restricted </text>
<text top="99" left="9" width="404" height="13" font="5">form, always anxious to steer clear of rival political groups angling for their support.</text>
<text top="125" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">During the critical years that followed my first experience of the unseen, the work centre of our group served for me the </text>
<text top="139" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">twofold purpose of providing congenial occupation without any curtailment of my freedom, and also a fruitful and </text>
<text top="153" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">healthy hobby for my leisure. I had for the first time tasted the joy of a new existence and it maddened me to an extent I </text>
<text top="167" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">could not believe possible, creating a feeling of estrangement from the world and an aversion towards the things of life </text>
<text top="181" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">as if I were a captive in an alien land impatient to break away from the prison but unable to do so. I might have turned a </text>
<text top="195" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">recluse to assuage the fire of renunciation kindled in me but for the constant touch with suffering and misery and the </text>
<text top="208" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">slender chance I had of alleviating it. My active participation in the charitable endeavour, though extremely limited in </text>
<text top="222" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">scope, conduced to some extent to keep me normal with enough attachment for the world to combat the morbid escapist </text>
<text top="236" left="9" width="537" height="13" font="5">tendencies that had developed in me. The rest was accomplished by my wife, whose immense love, unremitting </text>
<text top="250" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">attention to my smallest need, and constant care made me so dependent on her that the idea of residing in solitude, away </text>
<text top="264" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">from her even for a short time, appeared too formidable to be possible of execution by one in such an extremely delicate </text>
<text top="278" left="9" width="173" height="13" font="5">and peculiar state of health as I was.</text>
<text top="304" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">From the very beginning of the new development, many persons prompted by desire or driven by necessity came to see </text>
<text top="318" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">me with an ulterior object in view. They waited for hours, seeking an opportunity to talk to me alone about the purpose </text>
<text top="332" left="9" width="541" height="13" font="5">of their visit. During the earlier period, when the crowds showed no sign of diminution and I was generally in an </text>
<text top="346" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">elevated and far-from-communicative mood, they came several times in succession until able to snatch a few minutes of </text>
<text top="360" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">private conversation with me. For most of them I had attained a state of authority, of command over the subtle forces of </text>
<text top="374" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">nature, able to do and undo things, competent to alter circumstances, to change the destiny and modify the effect of </text>
<text top="388" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">other people's actions and conduct. They allotted to me a position of suzerainty, of close intimacy with the Almighty, </text>
<text top="402" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">with powers to defy the laws of nature and to interrupt the march of events by merely a gesture or an effort of my will. I </text>
<text top="416" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">heard their stories in silence, touched at the scenes of human misery and tales of harrowing grief which they narrated. </text>
<text top="430" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">Some were destitute, some unemployed, some childless, some involved in litigation, some hopeless invalids, some in the</text>
<text top="444" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">grip of reverses, some entangled in domestic troubles, and so on. They expected me to intercede with fate on their behalf</text>
<text top="458" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">to rid them of their sorrows and to free them from their difficulties against which they were powerless to battle, and </text>
<text top="472" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">were eager to catch at every passing chance, holding the slenderest ray of hope as a drowning man catches at a straw. </text>
<text top="485" left="9" width="529" height="13" font="5">They were all of them afflicted, frustrated, or disillusioned men and women for whom life was a bed of thorns.</text>
<text top="511" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">The general belief among the masses about psychics and men of vision, stretching back to prehistoric times, credits </text>
<text top="525" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">them with amazing supernatural powers. The impression is that they possess a mysterious link with or control over </text>
<text top="539" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">subtle, intelligent forces of nature and command over the elementals and spirits. I could not escape the consequences of </text>
<text top="553" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">this conception, and no amount of denial and argument on my part was effective in carrying conviction to people not </text>
<text top="567" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">only deeply steeped in the superstition from early childhood but also forced by exceedingly painful situations to be </text>
<text top="581" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">eagerly on the lookout for a supernatural source to extricate them from their difficulties. Not a few of them, ascribing </text>
<text top="595" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">my honestly expressed inability to help them out of their afflictions to reluctance on my part to do anything, behaved </text>
<text top="609" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">like children, imploring my assistance with folded hands and tears in their eyes. The sight of tears and manly voices </text>
<text top="623" left="9" width="396" height="13" font="5">husky with emotion left me powerfully affected, as shaken with grief as they were.</text>
<text top="649" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">These afflicted men and women who came to me for a miraculous escape from their ills were mostly the victims of </text>
<text top="663" left="9" width="546" height="13" font="5">social injustice, and my heart went out to them, in sympathy. In their position I, too, might have acted in the same </text>
<text top="677" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">manner. My utter inability to relieve their distress added so greatly to my sorrow at their misery that, unable to bear it, I </text>
<text top="691" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">sometimes had to seek the sanctuary of my deeper being to gain assurance and strength to overcome it. I consoled them </text>
<text top="705" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">as best as I could, and often they went in a more peaceful frame of mind than that in which they had come, leaving me </text>
<text top="719" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">restless and unsatisfied, heavy with their grief, vividly conscious of the fact that forming as we do the tiny individual </text>
<text top="733" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">cells of a mighty organism, we share alike the sorrows and misery existing in the world; but debarred from realizing it </text>
<text top="747" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">by the wall of ego segregating each cell from the rest, we feel happy and proud at acquisitions often purchased at our </text>
<text top="760" left="9" width="306" height="13" font="5">own cost, which we mistakenly believe has been paid by others.</text>
<text top="786" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">While there is a solid foundation for the venerable belief which attributes transcendental powers to visionaries, the </text>
<text top="800" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">popular idea has persisted through centuries that those possessing the power are in a position to set aside the laws of </text>
<text top="814" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">nature and to change the ordained course of events. This idea rests on an incorrect evaluation of the position and also on </text>

<text top="3" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">an unhealthy attitude towards the problems of life. The development of a supersensory channel of knowledge for the </text>

<text top="87" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">than the utilization of the quality of heaviness in gold for the purpose of crushing stones with it to provide material for </text>
<text top="101" left="9" width="545" height="13" font="5">roads. The curative and other powers sometimes exercised by mystics and saints never went beyond the sphere of </text>
<text top="115" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">individual application, and it was left for men of genius who brought vision to the aid of intellect to devise universally </text>
<text top="129" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">efficacious remedies for scourges like smallpox, and to make other discoveries in the physical realm, a task which was </text>
<text top="143" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">neither accomplished by nor fell in the province of prophets and visionaries. As time wore on and I firmly refused to be </text>
<text top="157" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">tempted into making a vulgar exhibition or impious use of the priceless gift which heaven had bestowed on me, there </text>
<text top="171" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">occurred a perceptible thinning in the number of supplicants who came purely with the object of a miraculous redress, </text>
<text top="185" left="9" width="538" height="13" font="5">and ultimately they ceased altogether. I scrupulously adhered to a normal mode of life, performing all the duties </text>
<text top="199" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">incumbent on me as the head of a family, and in my dress, manner, and behaviour displayed not the slightest deviation </text>
<text top="212" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">from the pattern which I should have followed in the usual course. This made most of the people, who in the beginning </text>
<text top="226" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">had evinced the deepest interest in my astounding performance, revise their opinion and regard the development as </text>
<text top="240" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">either freakish, disappearing as mysteriously as it had come to pass, or as an abnormality that subsided of its own accord</text>
<text top="254" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">with the passage of time. In the course of a few years the incident, after existing as a nine-day wonder, was almost </text>
<text top="268" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">forgotten and is now seldom mentioned save by traducers, who refer to it as an incontestible proof of my eccentric </text>
<text top="282" left="9" width="212" height="13" font="5">disposition when they wish to run me down.</text>
<text top="308" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">In view of this experience I wonder at the inability of the mass mind to move out even an inch beyond the accustomed </text>
<text top="322" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">rut. Barring not more than half a dozen people in all, the thousands who came to see me evinced not the least curiosity </text>
<text top="336" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">to know how the development had occurred and what the mystery was behind the surprising manifestation. If in the </text>
<text top="350" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">beginning, side by side with the manifestation, I had started to talk and whisper in a mysterious manner and edited </text>
<text top="364" left="9" width="527" height="13" font="5">recondite volumes for mystified readers to pore over, each at liberty to draw his own meaning from the vague </text>
<text top="378" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">expressions and obscure passages, instead of making a plain, unambiguous statement of facts, and had followed the </text>
<text top="392" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">same principle in my dress and behaviour, the interest and curiosity created would have increased enormously, at least </text>
<text top="406" left="9" width="397" height="13" font="5">for a period, securing me not only popularity but money as well at the cost of truth.</text>
<text top="472" left="9" width="125" height="20" font="3">Chapter Eighteen</text>
<text top="504" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="10"><b>IN </b>the course of time I came more and more towards the normal, while retaining the heightened state of consciousness </text>
<text top="518" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">inviolate, and descending mentally from a state of intoxication to one of sobriety. I became more keenly conscious of </text>
<text top="532" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">the fact that though my psycho-physiological equipment had now attained a condition that made it possible for me on </text>
<text top="546" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">occasions to transcend the boundary rigidly confining the mental activity of my fellow beings, I was essentially in no </text>
<text top="560" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">way different from or superior to them. Physically I was what I had been before, as susceptible to disease, decay, and </text>
<text top="574" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">age, as liable to accident and calamity, as prone to hunger and thirst as I always had been, a normal man in every other </text>
<text top="588" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">way save the alteration in the mental sphere, which by bringing me on occasions nearer to sober metaphysical realities, </text>
<text top="602" left="9" width="539" height="13" font="5">as astounding and remote from our ordinary conceptions as light is from darkness, had a curbing effect upon the </text>
<text top="616" left="9" width="543" height="13" font="5">frivolous and vain tendencies of my mind. I had in no way overcome the biological limitations of my body, in no </text>
<text top="630" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">manner exceeded the measure of its endurance and physical capacity, or attained any miraculous powers to defy the </text>
<text top="644" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">laws of nature. On the other hand, my system had grown more delicate. I was the same man, now advanced in age, who </text>
<text top="658" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">had sat for meditation on the memorable day when I had my first experience of the superphysical, with the difference </text>
<text top="672" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">that since then my brain has been attuned to finer vibrations from the unimaginable conscious universe all around us, </text>
<text top="686" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">and has in consequence acquired a deeper and more penetrating inner vision. Except for the alteration in the vital current</text>
<text top="700" left="9" width="547" height="13" font="5">and certain peculiar biological changes there was no distinctive external feature to mark me out from the rest. The </text>
<text top="713" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">moods of deep absorption, leading to the indescribable super-condition on occasions, became a normal feature of my </text>
<text top="727" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">existence. I lost touch with it, however, during intervals of illness and in the debilitated condition of the system which </text>
<text top="741" left="9" width="100" height="13" font="5">followed in its wake.</text>
<text top="767" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">The transcendental experience has been repeated so often that there is no room for doubt about its validity, and it tallies </text>
<text top="781" left="9" width="531" height="13" font="5">so clearly with the descriptions left by mystics and yogis as to yield no possibility of mistaking it for any other </text>
<text top="795" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">condition. The experience is genuine beyond question, but there is a difference in my recognition of it as compared to </text>
<text top="809" left="9" width="542" height="13" font="5">that accorded it in the past. The variation lies in treating the manifestation not as a mark of special divine favour, </text>
<text top="823" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">vouchsafed to me in particular or earned by me as a reward for merit, but as an ever-present possibility, existing in all </text>

<text top="3" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">human beings by virtue of the evolutionary process still at work in the race, tending to create a condition of the brain </text>

<text top="31" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">consciousness far above that which is the normal heritage of mankind at present. In other words, instead of believing </text>
<text top="45" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">that the experience, in spite of its marvellous and sublime nature, denotes a subjective apprehension of ultimate reality, </text>
<text top="59" left="9" width="523" height="13" font="5">complete and whole, it represents to me an upward climb from one rung of the ladder of evolution to another.</text>
<text top="85" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">To me there appears to be no reason to attribute the phenomenon to the direct intervention of Divine Will, irrespective </text>
<text top="99" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">of physical and spiritual cosmic laws. The progress made by man during the aeonic cycle of his evolution could not be </text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">accidental, nor could his transformation be effected without divine guidance and favour at every step. It would be little </text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">short of ridiculous to assume that he is dearer to God now than he was a million years ago, and is entitled at present to </text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">special favours withheld at that time. Unless we eliminate Divinity altogether from creation or at least from the whole </text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">scheme of organic evolution, there is no alternative but to accept the origin and subsequent development of the latter </text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">from the first stir of life in the primordial state to the emergence of man as being due entirely to the operation of Divine </text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">Will acting through eternal laws, obscure and unintelligible to us at present. The distance left behind by man on his </text>
<text top="197" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">ascent from the lowland of instinct to the height of a rational being was as essential a lap of his journey as that now in </text>
<text top="210" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">front of him from the state of an earth-bound mortal to the heaven-kissed peak of godhood. The former owed its origin </text>
<text top="224" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">as much to Divine Will as does the latter, both dependent for success on the proper observance of still obscure cosmic </text>
<text top="238" left="9" width="25" height="13" font="5">laws.</text>
<text top="264" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">There is a law at work even in such cases where the manifestation is sudden, following extraordinary spiritual striving </text>
<text top="278" left="9" width="532" height="13" font="5">and penance, or without it, or there occurs to all appearances a miraculous intervention at a critical moment, as </text>
<text top="292" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">happened in my case more than once, for which there is absolutely no explanation and no alternative except to treat the </text>
<text top="306" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">phenomenon as an act of divine grace. I do not know whether it was owing to the nature of the manifestation or to the </text>
<text top="320" left="9" width="518" height="13" font="5">fact that I was vouchsafed the privilege while leading the normal life of a householder without any previous </text>
<text top="334" left="9" width="548" height="13" font="5">indoctrination, religious bias, or monastic mental discipline, but the fact remains that from the very start an inborn </text>
<text top="348" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">conviction gradually gathered shape in my mind that what I experienced in the transcendental state is but the next higher</text>
<text top="362" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">phase of consciousness which humanity is destined to acquire in course of time as its normal possession, aspiring again </text>
<text top="376" left="9" width="336" height="13" font="5">to a still more sublime form impossible even to conceive of at present.</text>
<text top="402" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">Warned by the ill effects that followed my excessive absorption in the superconscious at Jammu, I tried and gradually </text>
<text top="416" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">succeeded in exercising restraint and moderation on the supersensory activity of my mind by keeping myself engaged in</text>
<text top="430" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">healthy temporal pursuits and the work of the organization. The exhausting mental effort needed for the reception of </text>
<text top="444" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">compositions in languages other than those known to me was too high a price to be paid for a performance which at the </text>
<text top="458" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">most had only a sensational or surprise value for others. I found in the course of time that only a slight knowledge of a </text>
<text top="472" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">language was sufficient to enable me to receive passages in verse without straining the memory or causing a harmful </text>
<text top="485" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">fatigue of the sensitive brain. Perhaps because of the possibility of injury, due to the strenuous mental exertion required </text>
<text top="499" left="9" width="535" height="13" font="5">in the reception of unknown languages, this phase of the newly developed psychic activity ceased after a while. </text>
<text top="513" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">Passages in the known languages continued to come off and on, especially during the three months of winter, when </text>
<text top="527" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">probably owing to a greater adaptability to cold than to heat my system can sustain the higher moods more easily than in</text>
<text top="541" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">summer. But whether summer or winter, it is essential for the supersensual play of my mind that the body be in normal </text>
<text top="555" left="9" width="218" height="13" font="5">health, entirely free of sickness and infection.</text>
<text top="581" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">The luminous glow in the head and cadence in the ears continue undiminished. There is a slight variation in the lustre as</text>
<text top="595" left="9" width="545" height="13" font="5">well as in the quality of the sounds during bodily or mental disturbance, which clearly indicates at least as close a </text>
<text top="609" left="9" width="543" height="13" font="5">relationship between the now highly extended consciousness and organism as existed between the two before the </text>
<text top="623" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">awakening. My reaction to infection and disease is slightly different; first, an utter absence of or only a slight rise in </text>
<text top="637" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">temperature during illness, with an abnormal rapidity of pulse, secondly, my inability to undergo a fast with safety. It </text>
<text top="651" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">appears that the drain on the vital fuel in my system to feed the ever-burning flame across the forehead is too excessive </text>
<text top="665" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">and the reserve of energy too small to allow it to carry on the highly increased vital activity for lengthy periods without </text>
<text top="679" left="9" width="545" height="13" font="5">replenishment. This susceptibility of the organism might be because of the tremendous strain borne or even slight </text>
<text top="693" left="9" width="533" height="13" font="5">damage sustained by my nervous system on more than one occasion, owing to my unconscious violation of the </text>
<text top="707" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">conditions governing my new existence, or to the inherent weakness of some vital organ, or to both. For this reason in </text>
<text top="721" left="9" width="395" height="13" font="5">any disorder of the system I have to be extremely careful about diet and regularity.</text>
<text top="747" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">Apart from the crises I had to face in the spiritual domain, fate had destined me for no less severe trials in the temporal </text>
<text top="760" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">sphere as well. The severance of my connection with the office resulted in the reduction of my income by one half, on </text>
<text top="774" left="9" width="545" height="13" font="5">which I had to maintain myself and my family. I was in too delicate and precarious a condition both mentally and </text>
<text top="788" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">physically for years to allow me to take up any occupation to augment my resources requiring sustained attention and </text>
<text top="802" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">labour. I needed freedom and rest to save myself from a mental disaster in that extremely sensitive condition of the </text>
<text top="816" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">brain. During this very period the prices of commodities soared, making it impossible for us with our small income to </text>

<text top="3" left="9" width="539" height="13" font="5">make ends meet. Far from stretching my hand to anyone for help, I did not even allow the least indication of our </text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">crushing poverty to leak out. I had no brother or uncle from whom to expect assistance. My poor father-in-law, always </text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">solicitous for my welfare, was shot dead by the raiders at the time of their incursion in 1947, and his eldest son was held </text>
<text top="45" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">captive at Bunji where he underwent great hardships for more than a year before securing his freedom. His younger </text>
<text top="59" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">brothers had their own hands full trying to retrieve the ruined fortune of the plundered and ravaged family. My two </text>
<text top="73" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">sisters, both extremely kind and affectionate to me, were themselves caught in economic distress and for years could not</text>
<text top="87" left="9" width="347" height="13" font="5">extricate themselves sufficiently to plant their feet on firm ground again.</text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="544" height="13" font="5">The chilling wave of penury which submerged us swept over almost all the families closely bound to us in ties of </text>
<text top="127" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">kinship and there could be no possibility of support from any side. Even if there had been, I should have been the last </text>
<text top="141" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">person to avail myself of it. Although we suffered terribly, not the least gesture was made to anyone for help. Compared </text>
<text top="155" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">to pre-war prices, the cost of food had risen many times as the result of inflation apparent everywhere. The whole salary </text>
<text top="169" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">I received from the office before my retirement, even if doubled, could not have enabled us to meet the needs of our </text>
<text top="183" left="9" width="528" height="13" font="5">small family in the face of the high rise in prices, and even in the normal course would have entailed financial </text>
<text top="197" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">difficulties. But with the income halved, the cost of living at least fourfold, and the unavoidable demand for a more </text>
<text top="210" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">nutritious and hence more costly diet for me with absolutely no other source of income and no possibility of one, placed </text>
<text top="224" left="9" width="440" height="13" font="5">me in an indescribable predicament at a time when I was mentally in a precarious condition.</text>
<text top="250" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">The struggle lasted for nearly seven years. Only the heroism of my wife saved my life. She sold her ornaments and </text>
<text top="264" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">denied herself to the limit to provide the indispensable articles of food needed for my use. I was utterly powerless to </text>
<text top="278" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">prevent her from doing so and had to continue as an impotent witness to her sacrifice. She was the only person who </text>
<text top="292" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">knew all about my condition, and, without in the least understanding the real significance of the development, tortured </text>
<text top="306" left="9" width="533" height="13" font="5">herself to save me from the pain of violent bodily disorders which invariably followed in the wake of a marked </text>
<text top="320" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">irregularity or deficiency in diet. On no less than three occasions during this period I came back from the jaws of death, </text>
<text top="334" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">not because of any caprice of the mighty energy now inhabiting my body, or owing to any deliberate omission on my </text>
<text top="348" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">part, but because of grinding poverty, lack of amenities, insufficient and unsuitable diet, which in spite of the heroism of</text>
<text top="362" left="9" width="557" height="13" font="5">my wife and the sacrifice of my two young sons, who often insisted on surrendering a part of their own share to me, </text>
<text top="376" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">could not be what it should have been because of the utter inadequacy of our finances. On such occasions, lying in a </text>
<text top="390" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">state of utter exhaustion on the sick bed, I wondered at the stupendous mystery of fate which allowed one destined to </text>
<text top="404" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">reveal a mighty secret to be distressed and tortured for the lack of a few coins which flowed in streams on every side and</text>
<text top="418" left="9" width="544" height="13" font="5">were scattered right and left by many on trifles every day. But even in the most gloomy conditions an unshakable </text>
<text top="432" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">conviction always persisted in my mind like a solitary star, gleaming faintly in an otherwise darkly threatening sky, that </text>
<text top="446" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">I would somehow survive the crisis and live to place in the hands of mankind the great secret on which depended the </text>
<text top="460" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">future safety of the race. It was mainly because of this inward strength, which no external source could infuse in me, that</text>
<text top="474" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">I was able to put up a strong resistance even in the most desperate situations with no possibility of help from any earthly </text>
<text top="487" left="9" width="34" height="13" font="5">source.</text>
<text top="513" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">The evil effects of these serious breakdowns in health, the unavoidable result of destitution, lasted for several months </text>
<text top="527" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">each time and once for nearly two years. During such periods until the body regained the depleted store of vital energy, I</text>
<text top="541" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">lost the sublime moods and for part of the time even suffered from disquieting mental symptoms. But there was no </text>
<text top="555" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">diminution in the vital current or in the radiant halo around the head even in the weakest conditions. The violent reaction</text>
<text top="569" left="9" width="534" height="13" font="5">of my system to any default on my part, which impeded in any way the action of the processes going on inside, </text>
<text top="583" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">especially any laxity in the matter of nutrition, was clearly understandable. It is necessary for any natural transformative </text>
<text top="597" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">tendency to be effective that it should be attended by a biological activity directed to that end, and for any biological </text>
<text top="611" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">activity to be operative, food in sufficient quantity and wholesome form is an indispensable and primary requirement. If </text>
<text top="625" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">it is obligatory for an athlete to adhere to certain rigid rules of conduct, to have regular hours of rest and a balanced diet, </text>
<text top="639" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">how much more necessary it is for one whose entire organism is in a state of feverish activity, akin to the exertions of an</text>
<text top="653" left="9" width="528" height="13" font="5">athlete during intensive training, to be cautious in all these and other respects in order to save his system from </text>

<text top="541" left="9" width="540" height="13" font="5">which I witness day after day in my own mortal frame. I regard the manifestation with the same feelings of awe, </text>
<text top="555" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">adoration, and wonder with which I regarded it on the first occasion, the feelings having increased in intensity and not </text>

<text top="637" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">necessary or even desirable for him either to neglect his flesh or to deny a place to the human feelings in his heart. A </text>

<text top="733" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">I have every reason to believe that mystical experience and transcendental knowledge can come to a man as naturally as </text>

<text top="143" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="6"><i>Verse </i>comes naturally to those seized by what Plato called 'mania' or divine frenzy. Shakespeare in one phrase joins 'the</text>
<text top="157" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">lover, the lunatic, and the poet'. Lovers compose poems; mystics (the prophets, Blake, John of the Cross) use the verse</text>
<text top="171" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">form; haiku and Zen go together; and even some alchemists recounted their experiences in poetry. Those in analysis</text>
<text top="185" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">frequently find that only verse is suitable for giving form to what is going on—and this expression has nothing to do</text>
<text top="199" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">with art. Characteristic of verse is rhythm, the use of words for sound as well as sense, the symbolic cluster of meaning,</text>
<text top="213" left="9" width="543" height="13" font="5">brevity and intensity. Verse has a ritualistic aspect. It is language as revelation, as pure symbol; echoed in it is the</text>
<text top="227" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">primitive throb of the dance, the ritual chant, and the nonsense of the child. It would seem to be the true language of the</text>
<text top="241" left="9" width="28" height="13" font="5">spirit.</text>
<text top="267" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">That his verse came in many tongues is a fact not unknown to parapsychological research. In trance states there are </text>
<text top="281" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">mediums who do speak in foreign tongues, even converse in languages they do not consciously know, nor have ever </text>
<text top="295" left="9" width="538" height="13" font="5">learned. These cases of glossolalia are evidence for what Dr Ian Stevenson, who is the pioneering contemporary </text>
<text top="309" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">investigator in this field, calls reincarnation. Gopi Krishna would not deny this idea, but he finds another ground. His </text>
<text top="323" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">ability is owed less to a former incarnation than to his contact with the supersensible world through which all can be </text>
<text top="337" left="9" width="525" height="13" font="5">known. The great experience is set in paradoxes. This is typical of the indescribability of the highest mystical </text>
<text top="351" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">experiences. It is both 'nothing yet everything', 'immeasurable', 'yet no bigger than an infinitely small point', 'infinitely </text>
<text top="365" left="9" width="535" height="13" font="5">large and infinitely small at the same time'. This is the Atman, bigger than big and smaller than small. From the </text>
<text top="379" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">topological view of the psyche, the ego focus is identified with its objective psychic ground. This totality is of course </text>
<text top="392" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">spaceless, timeless, extending everywhere unendingly and eternally present, in so far as the human personality when </text>
<text top="406" left="9" width="543" height="13" font="5">released of its limitations of circumstance is part of the same matter, the same energy, which makes up the whole </text>
<text top="420" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">universe. That especially the categories of spatial size are used for this description (rather than say categories of motion, </text>
<text top="434" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">nature, time, love, etc.) reflects the difficulties inherent in ego formulations of such experiences. The ego is bound to its </text>
<text top="448" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">body and this body has its definite spatial limits. Grand as we may imagine ourselves to be, we are but minute figures in </text>
<text top="462" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">a vast Chinese landscape, and placed not even in the centre of the picture. Transcendence of ego limitations is therefore </text>
<text top="476" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">presented by the ego primarily as a leap out of its spatial limitation given by the body's pounds and inches. (Distorted </text>
<text top="490" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">forms of this discrepancy between ego experience and body limitations can be found in every depression and inflation, </text>
<text top="504" left="9" width="530" height="13" font="5">when one feels smaller than small, or bigger than big.) I would also hazard the guess that space is the category </text>
<text top="518" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">appropriate to intuition (extension of vision, light, all-encompassing) and therefore preferred by intuitive types, which I </text>
<text top="532" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">assume Gopi Krishna to be partly on the basis of our author's own admittedly obsessive (at times) preoccupation with </text>
<text top="546" left="9" width="388" height="13" font="5">diet, body, sensation and health, and his difficulties in regard to the factual order.</text>
<text top="572" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">The experience itself was ushered in with 'a cadence like the humming of a swarm of <i>bees'. </i>The 'bee-loud glade' is a </text>
<text top="586" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">favourite image in poetry and comes in mythology as well as in the Bible. But we must remember, in our text we are not</text>
<text top="600" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">dealing with images as in a Western individuation process reflected mainly in dreams, but with <i>lived </i>experiences. The </text>
<text top="614" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">whitening, the meat, the baby, the oil, were all <i>actualities </i>for our author. Because of this, we may gain some insight</text>
<text top="628" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">from his experiences into why the bee is a widespread symbol of natural wisdom. In addition to its natural intelligence</text>
<text top="642" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">and social organization used often as a metaphor for society, its conversion of nature into culture (honey and wax), its</text>
<text top="656" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">dancing, mating, feeding, building rituals, its death sting, its orientation ability—the bee sound (just as the numinous</text>
<text top="669" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">sound of the lion, the gander, the bull, etc.) evidently occurs, if we follow our text, at a special moment in the liberation</text>
<text top="683" left="9" width="521" height="13" font="5">experience. Perhaps it is the sound of a strata of instinctual earth wisdom, deeper than our mammalian blood,</text>
<text top="697" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">representing a spontaneous flight, wild yet ordered, of the collective spirit beyond personal individuality. The Pythian</text>
<text top="711" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">oracle spoke from such depths. Her psychic state was that kind of mania which Plato terms prophetic and which belongs</text>
<text top="725" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">to the God, Apollo. Her answers were in verse, 'some even maintained that the hexameter was invented at Delphi' (E. R.</text>
<text top="739" left="9" width="578" height="13" font="5">Dodds, <i>The Greeks and the Irrational, </i>Chap. 3 'The Blessings of Madness', <i>vid. </i>Notes and References). 'Pythia' refers to </text>
<text top="753" left="9" width="562" height="13" font="5">'Python', the snake that Apollo killed and who resided in that place. She was, in other words, the daimon of the snake </text>
<text top="767" left="9" width="577" height="13" font="5">itself, the serpent power now in female form giving utterance to its wisdom. Supposedly, the serpent's bones and/or teeth</text>
<text top="781" left="9" width="528" height="13" font="5">were used for her oracles. And: she was described in the Homeric hymn to Hermes as a 'delphic bee' (Kerenyi,</text>
<text top="795" left="9" width="531" height="13" font="5">'Gedanken über die Pythia'). Quite possibly, Gopi Krishna's experience of the bee-sound in connection with his</text>
<text top="809" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">prophetic verse corresponds with the actual experience of the Pythian oracle so that through his account some light is </text>

<text top="3" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">After this last, highest encounter, the return itself is threatened. He abandons his work, identifies for a time with the </text>
<text top="17" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="6"><i>image of the holy man, </i>feels purged 'clean of worldly love', and is ready to follow the traditional pattern of mystic seer, </text>
<text top="31" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">wandering, devoted only to the spirit. He views his attachment to the world as a weak spot in his system, but as we see </text>
<text top="45" left="9" width="461" height="13" font="5">later he is then reconciled with this attachment and in the last instance realizes its positive value.</text>
<text top="71" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">The <i>alternation of his states of consciousness </i>throughout the years, especially the loss of heavenly joy time and again, is</text>
<text top="85" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">also described by the alchemists. They said the Stone must be coagulated and dissolved again and again. The more it </text>
<text top="99" left="9" width="540" height="13" font="5">alternated between these opposites the more valuable it became. This lesson is hard to learn, for after every peak </text>
<text top="113" left="9" width="490" height="13" font="5">experience one wants to 'hold it', and after each valley experience one feels guilty, lost and humiliated.</text>
<text top="139" left="9" width="544" height="13" font="5">Again we have evidence that the development of ego and the development of awareness are separate matters. His </text>
<text top="153" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">external ego situation in fact deteriorated in that he no longer had a job and was reduced to living upon the sacrifices of </text>
<text top="167" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">his wife, nor did he feel himself to be of any use even in the realm of therapy with all those who came with problems. </text>

<text top="195" left="9" width="559" height="13" font="5">who are on the same path, but he is not a miracle man. To assume this role would be to misuse the experiences. This </text>
<text top="208" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">keeps our author from being a fraud and mountebank. He remains aware of his human limits, and he chooses to remain </text>
<text top="222" left="9" width="92" height="13" font="5">within those limits.</text>
<text top="248" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">By giving credit to his wife he acknowledges an archetypal aspect of this path. It is not taken alone; there is always the</text>
<text top="262" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">'other'—master, disciple, pupil, sister, wife, friend, beloved— who is the silent partner, who represents the human love</text>
<text top="276" left="9" width="552" height="13" font="5">and care, who carries the other side, gives encouragement by believing, and is the mortal twin to the immortal urge.</text>
<text top="302" left="9" width="518" height="13" font="5">It could be argued again that this dependence upon his wife and family, his precarious health and his general</text>
<text top="316" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">ineffectiveness as both householder and as healer negates all that has happened, so that it becomes merely a psychic</text>
<text top="330" left="9" width="538" height="13" font="5">aberration. He admits that were it not for his mother and his wife, he would have died long ago. So what has this</text>
<text top="344" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">twenty-five years of ordeal really achieved? What positive results give evidence of the Great Liberation? Is he not just</text>
<text top="358" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">where he started: in the mother-complex, a victim of mother-matter, passive, delicate, dependent? How these destructive</text>
<text top="372" left="9" width="476" height="13" font="5">negative thoughts must have tormented him—or would have tormented his counterpart in the West.</text>
<text top="398" left="9" width="566" height="13" font="5">However, within his tradition, this dependent relation to the Mother archetype is inevitable. Ramakrishna for example </text>

<text top="454" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">we are set a 'complex.' We in the West are often too quick to condemn the 'Mother' thereby cutting ourselves off from </text>
<text top="468" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">our own ground. Our author is neither paralysed by his passivity nor rebellious against it, and so he cannot be said to be </text>
<text top="481" left="9" width="553" height="13" font="5">caught in a complex. Rather, he lives the op-posites. On the one hand he is involved in the bold spiritual adventure, </text>
<text top="495" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">requiring the masculine virtues of endurance, courage and individuality, while on the other he acknowledges without </text>
<text top="509" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">shame his weakness, sensitivity and physical limitations. He accepts the feminine root, not only of the Kundalini, but of </text>
<text top="523" left="9" width="357" height="13" font="5">life itself, thereby showing us a positive relation to the maternal archetype.</text>
<text top="549" left="9" width="525" height="13" font="5">At the end of Chapter Eighteen, there is a passage which conveys what we might call his <i>declaration of faith, </i></text>
<text top="563" left="9" width="542" height="13" font="5">remarkable for its simplicity. 'I found that a man can rise from the normal to a higher level of consciousness by a </text>
<text top="577" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">continuous biological process, as regular as any other activity of the body, and that at no stage is it necessary or even </text>
<text top="591" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">desirable for him either to neglect his flesh or to deny a place to the human feelings in his heart.' The same credo could </text>
<text top="605" left="9" width="528" height="13" font="5">apply to analytical psychology with a few exceptions. Rather than 'biological' we might refer to the process as </text>
<text top="619" left="9" width="570" height="13" font="5">'psychological'. We might interpret 'flesh' and 'feelings' with more liberality so as to include more shadows of the body </text>
<text top="633" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">and the heart. We might raise a question about the continuity of this process, since it also seems to have a discontinuous </text>
<text top="647" left="9" width="549" height="13" font="5">aspect that works by leaps and jumps and that devolves backwards on to itself. It can even devour itself so that the </text>
<text top="661" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">accomplishments of one phase of life may all be consumed in later errors. Our psychological process is definitely not </text>
<text top="675" left="9" width="569" height="13" font="5">progressive, ever upward and ever better, much as we idealize it and much as older people are obliged to believe. Jung </text>
<text top="689" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">gives us models for the completeness of consciousness, but these models are to be found more in his books than in his </text>
<text top="703" left="9" width="554" height="13" font="5">disciples. But then Gopi Krishna too points the way in his own person and his writings, not through training others. </text>
<text top="717" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">However, for our psychology the overriding importance in his credo is its emphasis upon an instinct of individuation </text>
<text top="731" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">(which as I said Jung called the Kundalini) and the process character of consciousness. This implies that something is </text>
<text top="745" left="9" width="563" height="13" font="5">meant with our psychic lives, our souls, and that this urge of meaning is a regular (continuous) function of our bodily </text>
<text top="758" left="9" width="337" height="13" font="5">nature. It is possible to each and it does not deny the world and its life.</text>

<text top="408" left="9" width="568" height="13" font="5">wonderful mechanism, located at the base of the spine, depending for its activity mainly on the energy supplied by the </text>

<text top="436" left="9" width="556" height="13" font="5">as the means to develop spirituality, supernormal faculties and psychic powers, the mechanism has been known and </text>
<text top="450" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">manipulated from very ancient times. When manipulated and roused to intense activity by men already advanced on the </text>
<text top="464" left="9" width="536" height="13" font="5">path of progress and subject to numerous factors, especially favourable heredity, constitution, mode of conduct, </text>
<text top="478" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">occupation and diet, it can lead to most remarkable and extremely useful results, developing the organism by general </text>

<text top="749" left="9" width="550" height="13" font="5">All the Gods are within. This message is given by Heinrich Zimmer in his paper 'On the Significance of the Indian </text>
<text top="763" left="9" width="564" height="13" font="5">Tantric Yoga'. Within may mean within the psyche, within the body, within the collective unconscious. Gopi Krishna </text>
<text top="777" left="9" width="546" height="13" font="5">makes it explicit that what happened to him was not an act of God, person-to-person as for instance such mystical </text>
<text top="791" left="9" width="534" height="13" font="5">experiences might have been taken by a medieval Christian. It did not come from without but from within. The </text>
<text top="805" left="9" width="573" height="13" font="5">incarnation of these Gods within is a terrible task, as our text has shown. 'Whoever is near unto me is near unto the fire' </text>
<text top="819" left="9" width="565" height="13" font="5">is an apocryphal saying of Jesus. How are we to understand this incarnation? How arc we to read the purpose of these </text>
</page>
<page number="89" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="842" width="595">
<text top="3" left="9" width="269" height="13" font="5">events? What do the Gods and Goddesses want with us?</text>
<text top="29" left="9" width="571" height="13" font="5">So many questions flood in—metaphysical, historical, religious, that a psychologist is unable to cope. We can only turn</text>
<text top="43" left="9" width="551" height="13" font="5">to the case at hand. Our author knows what the Goddess wants of him and the publication of this book is part of the</text>
<text top="57" left="9" width="296" height="13" font="5">purpose of that which he has been driven and led to incarnate.</text>
<text top="83" left="9" width="558" height="13" font="5">The instinct of individuation, as the evolutionary energy in man, is given to every man. Our author's experiences, he </text>
<text top="97" left="9" width="572" height="13" font="5">tells us, are possible in varying forms to everyone. Furthermore, they are teleologically meant for everyone. Our task is </text>
<text top="111" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">to incarnate the Gods within. Having seen this as the result of decades of wrestling with himself and these Gods, he can </text>
<text top="125" left="9" width="522" height="13" font="5">give us a golden vision of how things not only might be, but are meant to be. Can we blame him for this vast </text>
<text top="139" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">speculation; is not this the stuff of prophecy and vision and is not our age deaf and dry to just such calls? The relation of</text>
<text top="153" left="9" width="574" height="13" font="5">the one who sees the shadows as shadows to those still in the cave is an archetypal problem. Our author has grasped the </text>
<text top="167" left="9" width="555" height="13" font="5">dilemma and spoken out. Our author does not believe that it is enough for the mystic 'to work out his salvation with </text>
<text top="181" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">diligence'; he feels a call to call others. In this respect he is not to be regarded as a mystic nor is this an account of an </text>
<text top="195" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">'experience' of which we have, due to drugs, more and more at hand from every side. He presents himself as a modern </text>
<text top="208" left="9" width="532" height="13" font="5">teacher and scientific inquirer into a realm that has been neglected and covered over with accounts of 'mystical </text>
<text top="222" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">experiences'. He does not want us to take this material as another variety of religious experience but as the very meaning</text>
<text top="236" left="9" width="94" height="13" font="5">of human life itself.</text>
<text top="262" left="9" width="567" height="13" font="5">The experience of himself as only a vessel through which the wind of human history blows and from which the call to </text>
<text top="276" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">others sounds is entirely in keeping with his point of view. As Professor Spiegelberg points out, Gopi Krishna never felt </text>
<text top="290" left="9" width="546" height="13" font="5">that what took place was personally his. From the beginning he was a mere instrument; therefore, at the end, he is </text>
<text top="304" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">merely a mouthpiece of a vaster truth. The degree to which the ego personality takes part in these collective unconscious</text>
<text top="318" left="9" width="561" height="13" font="5">events determines their final shape. In the West, the mystic or artist to whom the extraordinary happens hammers the </text>
<text top="332" left="9" width="560" height="13" font="5">impersonal into personal form and presses his own vision upon archetypal patterns. The specific absence of personal </text>
<text top="346" left="9" width="576" height="13" font="5">form, the characteristic of impersonality, is the mark of the East. Yet, Gopi Krishna's biography is personal and it is just </text>
<text top="360" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">this which makes it unusually contemporary and accessible. Just because this book from another culture is so accessible </text>
<text top="374" left="9" width="536" height="13" font="5">it meets us more than halfway, addressing to each reader a question about the nature of man. His question is the </text>
<text top="388" left="9" width="575" height="13" font="5">fundamental one. What could be more important to inquire about than the nature of man, his psyche, his spirit, his body,</text>
<text top="402" left="9" width="181" height="13" font="5">and the purpose of his consciousness?</text>
