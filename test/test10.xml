<text top="100" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">new  life was hard,  the change very drastic. A redeeming feature was that in Ramanashram, unlike in other </text>
<text top="126" left="72" width="468" height="11" font="0">Ashrams,  there  were  no compulsions  of  any  kind;  no programme  to be  followed,  no meetings,  study-</text>
<text top="152" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">classes  or <i>bhajan</i> to be attended,  so that the body was spared the additional strain of having to rise at an </text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">early hour every morning, or be in a certain place at a certain inconvenient time, and so on. Bhagavan was </text>
<text top="204" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">the most  liberal  of Gurus  in that  at  no time  did  he  consider the  need  to frame  rules  and regulations  to </text>
<text top="230" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">control the lives  of his disciples; nor did he believe in a common,  enforced discipline,  for he himself had </text>
<text top="256" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">attained  the  highest  without  them,  and  had  discovered  the  self-evident  truth,  illustrated  by  his  own </text>
<text top="282" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">experience,  that at  the right  time Realisation surges  up from within by a  free  impulse,  like the  budding </text>
<text top="308" left="72" width="122" height="11" font="0">and blossoming of a ﬂower.</text>
<text top="334" left="96" width="447" height="11" font="0">While  it  is  true  that  not  all  seekers  are  as  ripe  as  Bhagavan  was,  when the  ﬂood of  Realisation </text>
<text top="360" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">suddenly inundated him in his seventeenth year and, thus, need a discipline to transform the desultory life </text>
<text top="386" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">of the world,  to which they are accustomed,  into that of  self-controlled yogis,  yet  the discipline  that is </text>
<text top="412" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">imposed from without can neither bear the desired fruits nor endure. The discipline which is not known to </text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">fail is the one which is self-imposed,  constitutionally determined,  and readily applied by an inner urge of </text>
<text top="464" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">the awakened intellect. Hence Bhagavan left his disciples completely free to mould their lives as best they </text>
<text top="490" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">could. This physical freedom considerably helped me to tide over the ﬁrst few difﬁcult months of my new </text>
<text top="516" left="72" width="44" height="11" font="0">existence.</text>
<text top="542" left="96" width="444" height="11" font="0">The whole month of February 1936 I lived in the Ashram in a completely bare room with a sand-</text>
<text top="568" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">covered  ﬂoor  and palm  leaves  for  walls  and  roof.  In  March  I  started  constructing a  small  hut  for  my </text>
<text top="594" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">residence in the neighbourhood of the Ashram, as the next chapter will relate. No sooner was it ready than </text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">I moved to it. I hardly stayed in it in the daytime: my mind was wholly ﬁxed on the Master. So I spent my </text>
<text top="646" left="72" width="289" height="11" font="0">days and a part of my nights in the Hall, where he lived and slept.</text>
<text top="672" left="96" width="447" height="11" font="0">There  I  quietly  sat  and  listened  to  the  visitors’ talks  with  him  and  to  his  answers,  which  were </text>
<text top="698" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">sometimes  translated into English,  particularly if the questioner was  a  foreigner or a north Indian – not </text>

<page number="2" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="792" width="612">
<text top="74" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">always. His answers were fresh and sweet. His inﬂuence was all pervasive in his silence not less  than in </text>
<text top="100" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">his speech. To me in the beginning this was all the more perceptible in the contrast it offered to the hustle </text>
<text top="126" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">and  bustle  of the life on which I  had  just turned  my  back – to the  wasted energy,  the  false values,  the </text>
<text top="152" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">foolish expectations from ideals which are in themselves hollow reeds, the dreary intercourse with people </text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">with  whom  one  has  very  little  in  common;  to  the  social  rules  which  have  been  laid  down  by  many </text>
<text top="204" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">generations  of selﬁshness, convention and superstitions,  not to speak of the mess of politics, of rank and </text>
<text top="230" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">wealth,  and the bitter jealousy and hatred they breed in the minds of men. It is small wonder therefore that </text>
<text top="256" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">Bhagavan appears to the serious minded as  a beacon light in an otherwise impenetrable darkness,  and a </text>
<text top="282" left="72" width="69" height="11" font="0">haven of peace.</text>
<text top="308" left="96" width="447" height="11" font="0">Bhagavan was  then enjoying the sound,  robust health of middle age,  and could very well afford to </text>
<text top="334" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">be available at almost all hours of the day to devotees. The years 1936-1938 were very blissful, indeed, to </text>
<text top="360" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">us, when we could gather round his couch and speak to him as intimately as to a beloved father; tell him </text>
<text top="386" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">all our troubles  and show  him our letters without  let or hindrance. After 8 p.m. when the hall contained </text>
<text top="412" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">only the local residents,  we sat round him for a ‘family chat’ till  about 10 o’clock. Then he related to us </text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">stories  from the Puranas or the lives of Saints,  yielding to transportations  of emotions when he depicted </text>
<text top="464" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">scenes  of great <i>bhakti</i>,  or great human tragedies,  to which he was sensitive to the extreme. Then he shed </text>
<text top="490" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">tears which he vainly attempted to conceal. Some stories are memorable like the following one. Kabir was </text>
<text top="516" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">a  great  <i>bhakta</i>  (devotee)  and  lived  in  or  near  Benares  some  centuries  ago.  Although  he  had  <i>siddhis</i> </text>
<text top="542" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">(psychic  powers),  he earned his  livelihood by weaving. One day,  when he was working on his looms,  a </text>
<text top="568" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">disciple entered in great excitement  and said: “Sir,  there is a juggler outside here who is  attracting large </text>
<text top="594" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">crowds  by making his stick stand in the air”,  etc. Thereupon Kabir,  who like all  true saints,  discouraged </text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">the display of jugglery, wanting to shame the man, rushed out with a big ball of thread in hand. Seeing the </text>
<text top="646" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">long bamboo standing in the air, he threw  up the ball of thread,  which went up and up unwinding till the </text>
<text top="672" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">whole thread stood stiff in mid-air, and to a far greater height than the juggler’s stick, without any support </text>
<text top="698" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">whatever. The  people,  including the  juggler  himself,  were  stunned in amazement,  and  Sri  Bhagavan’s </text>

<page number="3" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="792" width="612">
<text top="74" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">eyes acted the amazement, while his hand stood high above his head in the position of that of Kabir when </text>
<text top="100" left="72" width="90" height="11" font="0">he threw up the ball.</text>
<text top="126" left="96" width="447" height="11" font="0">On  another  occasion  Bhagavan  recited  from  memory  a  poem  of  a  Vaishnava  Saint,  in  which </text>
<text top="152" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">occurred the  words  “Fold me in thy embrace,  O Lord,”  when  the  arms  of  Bhagavan joined  in a circle </text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">round the vacant  air before  him,  and his eyes  shone with devotional ardour,  while his  voice shook with </text>
<text top="204" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">stiﬂed sobs which did not escape our notice. It was fascinating to see him acting the parts he related,  and </text>
<text top="230" left="72" width="168" height="11" font="0">be in such exhilarated moods as these.</text>
<text top="256" left="96" width="447" height="11" font="0">Some disciples  and his  attendants used to sleep on the ﬂoor of  the  hall at  night. Bhagavan’s  sleep </text>
<text top="282" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">was very light: he woke every now and then,  and almost always he found an attendant nearby fully awake </text>
<text top="308" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">to say a few  words to,  and slept again. Once or twice he would go out for a few minutes, and,  by 5 a.m., </text>
<text top="334" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">when  the  Veda  chanters  came  from  the  township,  they  found  him  fully  awake  and  chatting  in  a  soft, </text>
<text top="360" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">subdued voice. Now  the <i>parayanam</i>would get started and go on for a little less than an hour, during which </text>
<text top="386" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">everybody abstained from talking, and Bhagavan often sat cross-legged and completely indrawn. Then he </text>
<text top="412" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">went  out  for bath,  breakfast,  and a little stroll  on the  hill,  and returned at about 7.30,  when visitors  and </text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">devotees  began  trickling in  – men,  women and children – till they ﬁlled the  hall  by about  9 a.m. This </text>
<text top="464" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">morning hour of the <i>parayanam</i> was the best time of the day for meditation: the congregation was small, </text>
<text top="490" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">women and children were absent,  the weather cool,  and the mind had not yet completely emerged to run </text>
<text top="516" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">its usual riot. Over and above this Bhagavan then shone in the stillness of his <i>samadhi</i>,  which permeated </text>
<text top="542" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">the hall  and  the  meditation of the  disciples. But  unfortunately I could not keep up this  attendance,  nor </text>
<text top="568" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">could I beneﬁt by it even when present, for my mind remained in the fog of somnolence. Being a life-long </text>
<text top="594" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">bad sleeper I never succeeded in making the  requisite six-hour sleep before six in the morning. Another </text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">tendency which I could not completely overcome was  intolerance to noise,  of which the hall was seldom </text>
<text top="646" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">free. Apart from the free  access to it  by all and sundry there was  also the freedom of singing,  which at </text>
<text top="672" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">times  took  one  by  surprise  at  a  moment  when  the  hall  was  plunged  in  silence  and  the  atmosphere </text>
<text top="698" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">conducive to meditation. All of a sudden a soprano voice rose from somewhere in the hall intoning some </text>
</page>
<page number="4" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="792" width="612">
<text top="74" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">hymn or other, or reciting some <i>shloka</i> in a South-Indian language, to be succeeded by a tenor or another </text>
<text top="100" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">soprano,  often the  latter,  in competition with a  male of the species,  till  Bhagavan went  out  at  his usual </text>
<text top="126" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">hours.  These were:  9.45  for  a  few  minutes,  11 o’clock for luncheon,  followed by the  midday stroll  in </text>
<text top="152" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">Palakottu, evening 4-45 on the hill, preceding the evening Veda<i>parayanam</i>,  and 7 o’clock for dinner. The </text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">best  I  could  do then  was  to remain  in  a  semi-contemplative  or  reﬂective  mood,  reserving  my serious </text>
<text top="204" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">meditation to the quiet  solitude of my own room. Major Chadwick,  the only other foreign resident then, </text>
<text top="230" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">who had preceded me to Ramanashram by exactly three months, used to wonder how  I could meditate in </text>
<text top="256" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">my room at all. I reciprocated by myself wondering how  he could seriously concentrate amidst so much </text>
<text top="282" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">disturbance in the hall. Even in as small a matter as this, it will be observed, individual idiosyncrasies are </text>
<text top="308" left="72" width="350" height="11" font="0">apparent. These lonely hours I snatched from the time when Bhagavan was out.</text>
<text top="334" left="96" width="447" height="11" font="0">Every  second  morning  I  went  all  alone  for  <i>pradakshina  </i>–  an  eight  mile  non-stop  trek  round </text>
<text top="360" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">Arunachala  hill  – which  took  me  almost  exactly  three  hours  to  accomplish.  This  had  its  own  special </text>
<text top="386" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">beneﬁt. At that early hour I generally was in a walking-meditation mood,  particularly as I expressly made </text>
<text top="412" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">a habit of it. The beneﬁt of regularity in the practice of <i>sadhana</i> is here fully borne out. Another factor to </text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">a successful <i>pradakshina</i> and,  to me, the greatest,  was the determination at the very start not to retrospect </text>
<text top="464" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">– not to look back upon the past – throughout the three-hour trek. I might look this side or that, but would </text>
<text top="490" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">never allow memory to ruin my calmness. Each time I caught memory sneaking in, I immediately brought </text>
<text top="516" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">my attention to  the  rhythm  of  my  footfalls  till  the  mind  regained  its  restful  state.  The  partial  fatigue </text>
<text top="542" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">experienced in the latter half of the journey automatically induced this  mental  rest without  much effort. </text>
<text top="568" left="72" width="259" height="11" font="0">Somehow this practice worked marvellously well with me.</text>
<text top="594" left="96" width="447" height="11" font="0">Speaking of retrospection, <i>sadhakas</i> must be warned against the tricks of memory, of which nothing </text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">is  more  harmful,  nothing  more  destructive  to  the  peace  of  mind  which  is  necessary  for  a  successful </text>
<text top="646" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="1"><i>sadhana</i>. It cannot be too often recommended to them to forbear looking into the past with its trials  and </text>
<text top="672" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">errors,  acts  of omission and commission,  regrets,  fear,  passion,  love and hatred,  personal  tragedies,  etc. </text>
<text top="698" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">Everything is dust, everything transitory, including the seemingly indissoluble human ties, more so wealth </text>
</page>
<page number="5" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="792" width="612">
<text top="74" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">and fame,  and,  thus, not worth a moment’s  regret. Nothing is  changeless  and lasting but the natural state </text>
<text top="100" left="72" width="78" height="11" font="0">of the pure being.</text>
<text top="126" left="96" width="447" height="11" font="0">Another disturbance in the hall was caused by the distribution of the offerings  on the spot,  be they </text>
<text top="152" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">mangoes,  raisins,  sugar-candy,  dates,  or merely puffed rice. The moment one came,  it went  immediately </text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">round,  after  having  been  ﬁrst  touched  and  tasted  by  Bhagavan,  so  that  he  who  happened  to  be  then </text>
<text top="204" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">plunged in meditation for an hour or so, on opening the eyes sometimes found bits of edibles near his feet </text>
<text top="230" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">or in his lap, awaiting his pleasure. This custom was wisely stopped in 1938,  when all the offerings were </text>
<text top="256" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">collected and distributed in the  dining hall  at  meal  times,  or among guests who could not eat the usual </text>
<text top="282" left="72" width="23" height="11" font="0">food.</text>
<text top="308" left="96" width="447" height="11" font="0">The constant inﬂux of visitors was of some help in that it afforded the much-needed relaxation to an </text>
<text top="334" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">otherwise tense life. Secondly the peculiar problems which visitors brought with them were a useful study </text>
<text top="360" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">– study of the human mind and the endless ills to which it is subject. The problems of the mind and the </text>
<text top="386" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">conditions  which  give  rise  to  them  are  inﬁnitely  more  numerous  than  the  variety  which  the  physical </text>
<text top="412" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">universe  presents  to the human  senses. Moreover,  watching  the masterly ways  Bhagavan tackled these </text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">problems was <i>sadhana</i> in itself.  Rationality was  the  very essence of his  arguments. Whilst the  ultimate </text>
<text top="464" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">answer  to all  the  questions  was  always  the  same,  namely,  “Find  out  who you are,”  he  ﬁrst  met  every </text>
<text top="490" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">questioner on his own ground,  and then slowly steered him round to the source of all problems – the Self </text>
<text top="516" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">– the realisation of which he held to be the universal panacea. Psychologists deal only with the working of </text>
<text top="542" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">the mind,  but  Bhagavan goes to the source,  the mind or Self itself. It was a wonder that all  visitors were </text>
<text top="568" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">agreeably impressed by him,  sometimes even without comprehending the  drift of his  ideas. People take </text>
<text top="594" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="1"><i>siddhis</i> as the sure sign of Perfection,  but few  understand the subtle inﬂuence of the truly Perfect person, </text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">who,  without  the deliberate use  of  miracles,  works  out  the transformation of the people who come  into </text>
<text top="646" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">contact with him,  more so the genuine disciples,  whom he actually turns into <i>muktas</i>,  or well on the way </text>
<text top="672" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">to <i>mukti</i>,  of  which external <i>siddhis</i>  are  totally incapable. Many of those  who  have had the  inestimable </text>
<text top="698" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">privilege of a long stay with Bhagavan bear witness to the blessedness which his mere presence conferred </text>

<text top="126" left="96" width="447" height="11" font="0">When the audience shrank, the Master at times became humorously autobiographical about his early </text>
<text top="152" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">school and home life,  or  about  his  many experiences  on the hill with sadhus,  devotees,  etc. One of the </text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">stories  was about a “miracle”  he had once performed in Skandashram,  when his mother one day, leaving </text>
<text top="204" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">him inside a room in deep <i>samadhi</i>,  bolted him in from outside and went to the town, and, on her return, </text>
<text top="230" left="72" width="471" height="11" font="0">to her great surprise, found him seated under a tree in the garden outside,  and the door still bolted,  as she </text>
