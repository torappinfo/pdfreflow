<text top="299" left="90" width="417" height="18" font="2">could stay in the air longer, with less effort. His glides </text>

<text top="143" left="90" width="420" height="18" font="2">screeching and fighting with the flock around the piers </text>
<text top="166" left="90" width="432" height="18" font="2">and fishing boats, diving on scraps of fish and bread. But </text>
<text top="188" left="90" width="194" height="18" font="2">he couldn't make it work. </text>
<text top="210" left="99" width="424" height="18" font="2">It's all so pointless, he thought, deliberately dropping a </text>
<text top="232" left="90" width="437" height="18" font="2">hard-won anchovy to a hungry old gull chasing him. I could </text>
<text top="255" left="90" width="431" height="18" font="2">be spending all this time learning to fly. There's so much </text>
<text top="277" left="90" width="67" height="18" font="2">to learn! </text>
<text top="299" left="99" width="419" height="18" font="2">It wasn't long before Jonathan Gull was off by himself </text>
<text top="322" left="90" width="341" height="18" font="2">again, far out at sea, hungry, happy, learning. </text>
<text top="344" left="99" width="389" height="18" font="2">The subject was speed, and in a week's practice he </text>
<text top="366" left="90" width="402" height="18" font="2">learned more about speed than the fastest gull alive. </text>
<text top="388" left="99" width="412" height="18" font="2">From a thousand feet, flapping his wings as hard as he </text>
<text top="411" left="90" width="410" height="18" font="2">could, he pushed over into a blazing steep dive toward </text>
<text top="433" left="90" width="418" height="18" font="2">the waves, and learned why seagulls don't make blazing </text>
<text top="455" left="90" width="405" height="18" font="2">steep pewer-dives. In just six seconds he was moving </text>
<text top="478" left="90" width="409" height="18" font="2">seventy miles per hour, the speed at which one's wing </text>
<text top="500" left="90" width="234" height="18" font="2">goes unstable on the upstroke. </text>
<text top="522" left="99" width="425" height="18" font="2">Time after time it happened. Careful as he was, working </text>
<text top="544" left="90" width="404" height="18" font="2">at the very peak of his ability, he lost control at high </text>

<text top="656" left="90" width="437" height="18" font="2">violently left, stall his right wing recovering, and flick like </text>
<text top="678" left="90" width="432" height="18" font="2">fire into a wild tumbling spin to the right. He couldn't be </text>
<text top="700" left="90" width="431" height="18" font="2">careful enough on that upstroke. Ten times he tried, and </text>

<page number="5" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="792" width="612">
<text top="76" left="90" width="402" height="18" font="2">all ten times, as he passed through seventy miles per </text>

<text top="121" left="90" width="289" height="18" font="2">control, crashing down into the water. </text>
<text top="143" left="99" width="403" height="18" font="2">The key, he thought at last, dripping wet, must be to </text>
<text top="166" left="90" width="411" height="18" font="2">hold the wings still at high speeds - to flap up to fifty </text>
<text top="188" left="90" width="429" height="18" font="2">and then hold the wings still. From two thousand feet he </text>
<text top="210" left="90" width="395" height="18" font="2">tried again, rolling into his dive, beak straight down, </text>
<text top="232" left="90" width="401" height="18" font="2">wings full out and stable from the moment he passed </text>
<text top="255" left="90" width="433" height="18" font="2">fifty miles per hour. It took tremendous strength, but it </text>
<text top="277" left="90" width="410" height="18" font="2">worked. In ten seconds he had blurred through ninety </text>
<text top="299" left="90" width="413" height="18" font="2">miles per hour. Jonathan had set a world speed record </text>
<text top="322" left="90" width="96" height="18" font="2">for seagulls! </text>
<text top="344" left="99" width="402" height="18" font="2">But victory was short-lived. The instant he began his </text>
<text top="366" left="90" width="432" height="18" font="2">pullout, the instant he changed the angle of his wings, he </text>
<text top="388" left="90" width="411" height="18" font="2">snapped into that same terrible uncontrolled disaster, </text>
<text top="411" left="90" width="397" height="18" font="2">and at ninety miles per hour it hit him like dynamite. </text>
<text top="433" left="90" width="416" height="18" font="2">Jonathan Seagull exploded in midair and smashed down </text>
<text top="455" left="90" width="159" height="18" font="2">into a brickhard sea. </text>
<text top="478" left="99" width="424" height="18" font="2">When he came to, it was well after dark, and he floated </text>
<text top="500" left="90" width="429" height="18" font="2">in moonlight on the surface of the ocean. His wings were </text>
<text top="522" left="90" width="420" height="18" font="2">ragged bars of lead, but the weight of failure was even </text>
<text top="544" left="90" width="420" height="18" font="2">heavier on his back. He wished, feebly, that the weight </text>
<text top="567" left="90" width="395" height="18" font="2">could be just enough to drug him gently down to the </text>
<text top="589" left="90" width="168" height="18" font="2">bottom, and end it all. </text>
<text top="611" left="99" width="384" height="18" font="2">As he sank low in the water, a strange hollow voice </text>
<text top="634" left="90" width="399" height="18" font="2">sounded within him. There's no way around it. I am a </text>
<text top="656" left="90" width="410" height="18" font="2">seagull. I am limited by my nature. If I were meant to </text>
<text top="678" left="90" width="434" height="18" font="2">learn so much about flying, I'd have charts for brains. If </text>

<text top="166" left="99" width="414" height="18" font="2">The voice faded, and Jonathan agreed. The place for a </text>

<text top="232" left="90" width="137" height="18" font="2">everyone happier. </text>
<text top="255" left="99" width="410" height="18" font="2">He pushed wearily away from the dark water and flew </text>
<text top="277" left="90" width="427" height="18" font="2">toward the land, grateful for what he had learned about </text>
<text top="299" left="90" width="426" height="18" font="2">work-saving low-altitude flying. But no, he thought. I am </text>
<text top="322" left="90" width="407" height="18" font="2">done with the way I was, I am done with everything I </text>
<text top="344" left="90" width="430" height="18" font="2">learned. I am a seagull like every other seagull, and I will </text>
<text top="366" left="90" width="437" height="18" font="2">fly like one. So he climbed painfully to a hundred feet and </text>
<text top="388" left="90" width="341" height="18" font="2">flapped his wings harder, pressing for shore. </text>
<text top="411" left="99" width="428" height="18" font="2">He felt better for his decision to be just another one of </text>

<text top="455" left="90" width="437" height="18" font="2">had driven him to learn, there would be no more challenge </text>
<text top="478" left="90" width="389" height="18" font="2">and no more failure. And it was pretty, just to stop </text>

<text top="455" left="90" width="431" height="18" font="2">put them to his test, a test that no gull had ever passed. </text>
<text top="478" left="90" width="405" height="18" font="2">He twisted his wings, slowed to a single mile per hour </text>
<text top="500" left="90" width="386" height="18" font="2">above stall. The two radiant birds slowed with him, </text>

<text top="544" left="99" width="400" height="18" font="2">He folded his wings, rolled and dropped in a dive to a </text>

<text top="349" left="90" width="414" height="18" font="2">changed. It felt like a seagull body, but alreadv it flew </text>
<text top="372" left="90" width="407" height="18" font="2">far better than his old one had ever flown. Why, with </text>

<text top="439" left="99" width="408" height="18" font="2">His feathers glowed brilliant white now, and his wings </text>
<text top="461" left="90" width="434" height="18" font="2">were smooth and perfect as sheets of polished silver. He </text>

<text top="617" left="90" width="387" height="18" font="2">was a limit to how much the new body could do, and </text>

<text top="299" left="90" width="426" height="18" font="2">Earth was falling away. Earth had been a place where he </text>
<text top="322" left="90" width="437" height="18" font="2">had learned much, of course, but the details were blurred </text>
<text top="344" left="90" width="422" height="18" font="2">- something about fighting for food, and being Outcast. </text>

<text top="455" left="99" width="397" height="18" font="2">He turned to land on the beach, beating his wings to </text>

<text top="500" left="90" width="426" height="18" font="2">The other gulls landed too, but not one of them so much </text>
<text top="522" left="90" width="414" height="18" font="2">as flapped a feather. They swung into the wind, bright </text>
<text top="544" left="90" width="401" height="18" font="2">wings outstretched, then somehow they changed the </text>

<text top="634" left="90" width="424" height="18" font="2">try it. Standiug there on the beach, still without a word </text>
<text top="656" left="90" width="171" height="18" font="2">spoken, he was asleep. </text>

<text top="188" left="90" width="396" height="18" font="2">and they spent hour after hour every day practicing </text>

<text top="544" left="90" width="435" height="18" font="2">well a one-in-a-million bird. Most of us came along ever so </text>
<text top="567" left="90" width="410" height="18" font="2">slowly. We went from one world into another that was </text>

<text top="455" left="99" width="409" height="18" font="2">&quot;Let's try it again.&quot; Sullivan said over and over: &quot;Let's </text>
<text top="478" left="90" width="383" height="18" font="2">try it again.&quot; Then, finally, &quot;Good.&quot; And they began </text>

<text top="522" left="99" width="412" height="18" font="2">And so they flew in from the west that morning, eight </text>

<text top="433" left="99" width="398" height="18" font="2">It took almost an hour for the Word of the Elder to </text>
