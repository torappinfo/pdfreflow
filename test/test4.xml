<text top="240" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">of monthly lessons, the first of which was issued in October, 1905, and the</text>
<text top="259" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">twelfth in September, 1906. These lessons met with a hearty and generous</text>
<text top="278" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">response from the public, and the present volume is issued in response to</text>
<text top="297" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">the demand for the lessons in a permanent and durable form. There have</text>
<text top="317" left="72" width="216" height="14" font="1">been no changes made in the text.</text>
<text top="355" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">The publishers take the liberty to call the attention of the reader to the great</text>

<text top="393" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">Students have told us that they have found it necessary to read and study</text>
<text top="413" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">each lesson carefully, in order to absorb the varied information contained</text>
<text top="432" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">within its pages. They have also stated that they have found it advisable to</text>
<text top="451" left="72" width="437" height="14" font="1">re−read the lessons several times, allowing an interval between each</text>
<text top="470" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">reading and that at each re−reading they would discover information that</text>

<text top="509" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">repeated to us so often that we feel justified in mentioning it, that other</text>

<text top="603" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">designed to enlighten them regarding the nature of the Real Self, and to</text>
<text top="622" left="72" width="440" height="14" font="1">instruct them in the secret knowledge whereby they may develop the</text>
<text top="641" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">consciousness and realization of the real &quot;I&quot; within them. They are shown</text>
<text top="660" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">how they may cast aside the erroneous or imperfect knowledge regarding</text>

<text top="718" left="72" width="439" height="14" font="1">Until the Candidate masters this instruction, or at least until the truth</text>

<text top="82" left="72" width="422" height="14" font="1">Identity, he is not able to understand the source of his power, and,</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">moreover, is not able to<i> feel</i> within him the power of the Will, which power</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="293" height="14" font="1">underlies the entire teachings of &quot;Raja Yoga.&quot;</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">The Yogi Masters are hot satisfied if the Candidate forms merely a clear</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">intellectual conception of this Actual Identity, but they insist that he must</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="3"><i>feel</i> the truth of the same−−must become<i> aware</i> of the Real Self−−must</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">enter into a consciousness in which the realization becomes a part of his</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="421" height="14" font="1">everyday self−−in which the realizing consciousness becomes the</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">prevailing idea in his mind, around which his entire thoughts and actions</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="52" height="14" font="1">revolve.</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="438" height="14" font="1">To some Candidates, this realization comes like a lightning flash the</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="426" height="14" font="1">moment the attention is directed toward it, while in other cases the</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">Candidates find it necessary to follow a rigorous course of training before</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="289" height="14" font="1">they acquire the realization in consciousness.</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="439" height="14" font="1">The Yogi Masters teach that there are two degrees of this awakening</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="393" height="14" font="1">consciousness of the Real Self. The first, which they call &quot;the</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">Consciousness of the 'I',&quot; is the full consciousness of<i> real</i> existence that</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">comes to the Candidate, and which causes him to<i> know</i> that he is a real</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">entity having a life not depending upon the body−−life that will go on in</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">spite of the destruction of the body−−<i>real</i> life, in fact. The second degree,</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">which they call &quot;the Consciousness of the 'I AM',&quot; is the consciousness of</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="419" height="14" font="1">one's identity with the Universal Life, and his relationship to, and</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">&quot;in−touchness&quot; with all life, expressed and unexpressed. These two degrees</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="447" height="14" font="1">of consciousness come in time to all who seek &quot;The Path.&quot; To some it</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">comes suddenly; to others it dawns gradually; to many it comes assisted by</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="312" height="14" font="1">the exercises and practical work of &quot;Raja Yoga.&quot;</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">The first lesson of the Yogi Masters to the Candidates, leading up to the</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">first degree, above mentioned, is as follows: That the Supreme Intelligence</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="452" height="14" font="1">of the Universe−−the Absolute−−has manifested the being that we call</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="418" height="14" font="1">Man−−the highest manifestation on this planet. The Absolute has</text>
<text top="735" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">manifested an infinitude of forms of life in the Universe, including distant</text>

<text top="63" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">worlds, suns, planets, etc., many of these forms being unknown to us on</text>
<text top="82" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">this planet, and being impossible of conception by the mind of the ordinary</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">man. But these lessons have nothing to do with that part of the philosophy</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">which deals with these myriad forms of life, for our time will be taken up</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="444" height="14" font="1">with the unfoldment in the mind of man of his true nature and power.</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">Before man attempts to solve the secrets of the Universe without, he should</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="436" height="14" font="1">master the Universe within−−the Kingdom of the Self. When he has</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="447" height="14" font="1">accomplished this, then he may, and should, go forth to gain the outer</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="487" height="14" font="1">knowledge as a Master demanding its secrets, rather than as a slave begging</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">for the crumbs from the table of knowledge. The first knowledge for the</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="252" height="14" font="1">Candidate is the knowledge of the Self.</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="446" height="14" font="1">Man, the highest manifestation of the Absolute, as far as this planet is</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">concerned, is a wonderfully organized being−−although the average man</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">understands but little of his real nature. He comprises within his physical,</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">mental and spiritual make−up both the highest and the lowest, as we have</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">shown in our previous lessons (the &quot;Fourteen Lessons&quot; and the &quot;Advanced</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">Course&quot;). In his bones he manifests almost in the form of mineral life, in</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">fact, in his bones, body and blood mineral substances actually exist. The</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="435" height="14" font="1">physical life of the body resembles the life of the plant. Many of the</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">physical desires and emotions are akin to those of the lower animals, and in</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="423" height="14" font="1">the undeveloped man these desires and emotions predominate and</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">overpower the higher nature, which latter is scarcely in evidence. Then</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">Man has a set of mental characteristics that are his own, and which are not</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">possessed by the lower animals (See &quot;Fourteen Lessons&quot;). And in addition</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">to the mental faculties common to all men, or rather, that are in evidence in</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">a greater or lesser degree among all men, there are still higher faculties</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">latent within Man, which when manifested and expressed render Man more</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">than ordinary Man. The unfoldment of these latent faculties is possible to</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">all who have reached the proper stage of development, and the desire and</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">hunger of the student for this instruction is caused by the pressure of these</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">unfolding latent faculties, crying to be born into consciousness. Then there</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">is that wonderful thing, the Will, which is but faintly understood by those</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">ignorant of the Yogi Philosophy−−the Power of the Ego−−its birthright</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="120" height="14" font="1">from the Absolute.</text>

<text top="63" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">But while these mental and physical things<i> belong</i> to Man, they are<i> not</i> the</text>
<text top="82" left="72" width="447" height="14" font="1">Man himself. Before the Man is able to master, control, and direct the</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">things belonging to him−−his tools and instruments−−he must awaken to a</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">realization of Himself. He must be able to distinguish between the &quot;I&quot; and</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="372" height="14" font="1">the &quot;Not I.&quot; And this is the first task before the Candidate.</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">That which is the Real Self of Man is the Divine Spark sent forth from the</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="349" height="14" font="1">Sacred Flame. It is the Child of the Divine Parent. It is</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">Immortal−−Eternal−−Indestructible−−Invincible. It possesses within itself</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">Power, Wisdom, and Reality. But like the infant that contains within itself</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">the sometime Man, the mind of Man is unaware of its latent and potential</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="448" height="14" font="1">qualities, and does not know itself. As it awakens and unfolds into the</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">knowledge of its real nature, it manifests its qualities, and realizes what the</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">Absolute has given it. When the Real Self begins to awaken, it sets aside</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">from itself those things which are but appendages to it, but which it, in its</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">half−waking state, had regarded as its Self. Setting aside first this, and then</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="452" height="14" font="1">that, it finally discards all of the &quot;Not I,&quot; leaving the Real Self free and</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="428" height="14" font="1">delivered from its bondage to its appendages. Then it returns to the</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="299" height="14" font="1">discarded appendages, and makes use of them.</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">In considering the question: &quot;What is the Real Self?&quot; let us first stop to</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="332" height="14" font="1">examine what man usually means when he says &quot;I.&quot;</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">The lower animals do not possess this &quot;I&quot; sense. They are conscious of the</text>

<text top="313" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">Masters so use it. The real knowledge, however, comes as a special form of</text>

<text top="293" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">that he attained a degree of Initiation in this way. He would repeat his own</text>

<text top="63" left="72" width="426" height="14" font="1">Candidate places himself in the State of Meditation, or at least in a</text>
<text top="82" left="72" width="448" height="14" font="1">thoughtful frame of mind, and then endeavors to &quot;imagine&quot; himself as</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">&quot;dead&quot;−−that is, he tries to form a mental conception of himself as dead.</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">This, at first thought, appears a very easy thing to imagine, but as a matter</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="425" height="14" font="1">of fact it is<i> impossible</i> to do so, for the Ego refuses to entertain the</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">proposition, and finds it impossible to imagine it. Try it for yourself. You</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="442" height="14" font="1">will find that you may be able to imagine your<i> body</i> as lying still and</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">lifeless, but the same thought finds that in so doing<i> You</i> are standing and</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="431" height="14" font="1">looking at the body. So you see that<i> You</i> are not dead at all, even in</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">imagination, although the body may be. Or, if you refuse to disentangle</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">yourself from your body, in imagination, you may think of your body as</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">dead but<i> You</i> who refuse to leave it are still<i> alive</i> and recognize the dead</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">body as a thing apart from your Real Self. No matter how you may twist it</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">you<i> cannot</i> imagine yourself as dead. The Ego insists upon being<i> alive</i> in</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">any of these thoughts, and thus finds that it has within itself the sense and</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">assurance of Immortality. In case of sleep or stupor resulting from a blow,</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">or from narcotics or anaesthetics, the mind is apparently blank, but the &quot;I&quot;</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">is conscious of a continuity of existence. And so one may imagine himself</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="437" height="14" font="1">as being in an unconscious state, or asleep, quite easily, and sees the</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">possibility of such a state, but when it comes to imagining the &quot;I&quot; as dead,</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">the mind utterly refuses to do the work. This wonderful fact that the soul</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">carries within itself the evidence of its own immortality is a glorious thing,</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="449" height="14" font="1">but one must have reached a degree of unfoldment before he is able to</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="165" height="14" font="1">grasp its full significance.</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">The Candidate is advised to investigate the above statement for himself, by</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">meditation and concentration, for in order that the &quot;I&quot; may know its true</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">nature and possibilities, it must realize that it cannot be destroyed or killed.</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">It must know what it is before it is able to manifest its nature. So do not</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">leave this part of the teaching until you have mastered it. And it is well</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">occasionally to return to it, in order that you may impress upon the mind</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">the fact of your immortal and eternal nature. The mere glimmering of this</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">conception of truth will give you an increased sense of strength and power,</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">and you will find that your Self has expanded and grown, and that you are</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="401" height="14" font="1">more of a power and Centre than you have heretofore realized.</text>

<text top="389" left="72" width="451" height="14" font="1">be killed, is wonderful, and tends to develop the full &quot;I&quot; consciousness</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">within you. For You−−the Real &quot;I&quot;−−are not body. You are Spirit. The Ego</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">is Immortal and Invincible, and cannot be killed and harmed. When you</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="449" height="14" font="1">enter into this realization and consciousness, you will feel an influx of</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">strength and power impossible to describe. Fear will fall from you like a</text>

<text top="370" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">or wound it. It cannot die. The trials of the physical life are but as dreams to</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">it. Resting secure in the knowledge of the 'I,' Man may smile at the worst</text>

<text top="315" left="72" width="445" height="14" font="1">the consciousness of the Candidate to a realization of the real &quot;I.&quot; We</text>
<text top="334" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">confined our instructions to the preliminary teachings of the reality of the</text>

<text top="372" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">of his real Self, and its independence from the body and the things of the</text>
<text top="391" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">flesh. We tried to show you how you might awaken to a consciousness of</text>
<text top="411" left="72" width="439" height="14" font="1">the reality of the &quot;I&quot;; its real nature; its independence of the body; its</text>
<text top="430" left="72" width="434" height="14" font="1">immortality; its invincibility and invulnerability. How well we have</text>
<text top="449" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">succeeded may be determined only by the experience of each Candidate,</text>
<text top="468" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">for we can but point out the way, and the Candidate must do the real work</text>
<text top="487" left="72" width="52" height="14" font="1">himself.</text>
<text top="526" left="72" width="445" height="14" font="1">But there is more to be said and done in this matter of awakening to a</text>
<text top="545" left="72" width="442" height="14" font="1">realization of the &quot;I.&quot; So far, we have but told you how to distinguish</text>
<text top="564" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">between the material coverings of the Ego and the &quot;I&quot; itself. We have tried</text>
<text top="583" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">to show you that you had a real &quot;I,&quot; and then to show you what it was, and</text>
<text top="603" left="72" width="452" height="14" font="1">how it was independent of the material coverings, etc. But there is still</text>
<text top="622" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">another step in this self analysis−−a more difficult step. Even when the</text>
<text top="641" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">Candidate has awakened to a realization of his independence of the body,</text>
<text top="660" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">and material coverings, he often confounds the &quot;I&quot; with the lower principles</text>
<text top="679" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">of the mind. This is a mistake. The Mind, in its various phases and planes,</text>
<text top="699" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">is but a tool and instrument of the &quot;I,&quot; and is far from being the &quot;I&quot; itself.</text>

<text top="159" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">or metaphysical talk, when the way to prove the thing is right within your</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">own grasp. By using the mind, you will be able to separate it into its parts,</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">and force it to give you its own answer to the questions touching itself.</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">In the second and third lessons of our &quot;_Fourteen Lessons_,&quot; we pointed</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">out to you the fact that man had three Mental Principles, or subdivisions of</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">mind, all of which were below the plane of Spirit. The &quot;I&quot; is Spirit, but its</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">mental principles are of a lower order. Without wishing to unduly repeat</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">ourselves, we think it better to run hastily over these three Principles in the</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="88" height="14" font="1">mind of Man.</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">First, there is what is known as the Instinctive Mind, which man shares in</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="435" height="14" font="1">common with the lower animals. It is the first principle of mind that</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">appears in the scale of evolution. In its lowest phases, consciousness is but</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">barely perceptible, and mere sensation is apparent. In its higher stages it</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">almost reaches the plane of Reason or Intellect, in fact, they overlap each</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">other, or, rather, blend into each other. The Instinctive Mind does valuable</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="456" height="14" font="1">work in the direction of maintaining animal life in our bodies, it having</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">charge of this part of our being. It attends to the constant work of repair;</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">replacement; change; digestion; assimilation; elimination, etc., all of which</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="339" height="14" font="1">work is performed below the plane of consciousness.</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">But this is but a small part of the work of the Instinctive Mind. For this part</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">of the mind has stored up all the experiences of ourselves and ancestors in</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">our evolution from the lower forms of animal life into the present stage of</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="447" height="14" font="1">evolution. All of the old animal instincts (which were all right in their</text>

<text top="82" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">may be able more readily to distinguish the &quot;I&quot; from the mind, or mental</text>

<text top="121" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">of the mind is good, and necessary, and the student must not fall into the</text>

<text top="351" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">And so far from decrying the Mind, the &quot;Raja Yoga&quot; teachers are chiefly</text>

<text top="274" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">must be able to distinguish the &quot;I&quot; from these mental conditions, which are</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="265" height="14" font="1">as much tools as is the body and its parts.</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">Let us begin by considering the thoughts more closely connected with the</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="328" height="14" font="1">body, and then work up to the higher mental states.</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="433" height="14" font="1">The sensations of the body, such as hunger; thirst; pain; pleasurable</text>

<text top="447" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">passed beyond this stage, and have learned to set aside these sensations, to</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">a greater or lesser extent, by an effort of the Will, and are no longer slaves</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">to them. Not that they do not experience these sensations, but they have</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="441" height="14" font="1">grown to regard them as incidents of the physical life−−good in their</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">place−−but useful to the advanced man only when he has mastered them to</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">the extent that he no longer regards them as close to the &quot;I.&quot; And yet, to</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="413" height="14" font="1">some people, these sensations are so closely identified with their</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">conception of the &quot;I&quot; that when they think of themselves they think merely</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">of a bundle of these sensations. They are not able to set them aside and</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">consider them as things apart, to be used when necessary and proper, but as</text>

<text top="697" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">knowing that his physical body is making demands for attention, and that</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">these demands should be heeded. But−−mark the difference−−instead of</text>

<text top="332" left="72" width="456" height="14" font="1">at mental arm's length. So into the &quot;not I&quot; collection go these emotions,</text>

<text top="447" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">undesirable ones, so much the better. This is not our object, for we bid you</text>

<text top="524" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">the nature of the &quot;I,&quot; you may return and use (as a Master) the things that</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">have been using you as a slave. So do not be afraid to throw these emotions</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">(good and bad) into the &quot;not I&quot; collection. You may go back to them, and</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">use the good ones, after the Mental Drill is over. No matter how much you</text>

<text top="409" left="72" width="440" height="14" font="1">to the best advantage, and he also learns how to pass on orders to the</text>

<text top="581" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">acquired there is no mystery or difficulty about it. And it is worth practice.</text>

<text top="121" left="72" width="452" height="14" font="1">candidate a realization in consciousness of the reality of the &quot;I,&quot; and to</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">enable him to distinguish between the Self and its sheaths, physical and</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">mental. In the present lesson we will call his attention to the relationship of</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="448" height="14" font="1">the &quot;I&quot; to the Universal &quot;I,&quot; and will endeavor to give him an idea of a</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">greater, grander Self, transcending personality and the little self that we are</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="166" height="14" font="1">so apt to regard as the &quot;I.&quot;</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="445" height="14" font="1">The keynote of this lesson will be &quot;The Oneness of All,&quot; and all of its</text>

<text top="293" left="72" width="487" height="14" font="1">that great truth. But we wish to impress upon the mind of the Candidate that</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">we are<i> not</i> teaching him that he is the Absolute. We are not teaching the &quot;I</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">Am God&quot; belief, which we consider to be erroneous and misleading, and a</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">perversion of the original Yogi teachings. This false teaching has taken</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="423" height="14" font="1">possession of many of the Hindu teachers and people, and with its</text>

<text top="428" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">negative mental condition which undoubtedly is retarding their progress.</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">Not only in India is this true, but the same facts may be observed among</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">the pupils of the Western teachers who have embraced this negative side of</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="429" height="14" font="1">the Oriental Philosophy. Such people confound the &quot;Absolute&quot; and</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">&quot;Relative&quot; aspects of the One, and, being unable to reconcile the facts of</text>

<text top="351" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">begin to grasp the idea of the Oneness of Spirit, and the relation of the &quot;I&quot;</text>

<text top="313" left="72" width="487" height="14" font="1">hard for us to realize this. We are so apt to think of our mental operations as</text>

<text top="543" left="72" width="436" height="14" font="1">the Ego in its progress were moving through great oceans of Matter,</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">Energy, or Mind−substance, making use of that of each which it needed</text>

<text top="601" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">on through the great volume of the ocean. This illustration is clumsy, but it</text>

<text top="351" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">see the reality−−Life. Feel yourself a part of the great Universal Life. Let</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">your thought sink to the depths of the ocean, and realize your kinship with</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">the Life back of the forms dwelling there. Do not confound the forms (often</text>

<text top="447" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">of form into the real Life behind and underneath the form. Learn to feel</text>

<text top="524" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">some of its myriad forms, and feel your kinship to it. If you can grasp this</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">thought and consciousness, you will find yourself at−one−ment with those</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="422" height="14" font="1">whirling worlds, and, instead of feeling small and insignificant by</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">comparison, you will be conscious of an expansion of Self, until you feel</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">that in those circling worlds is a part of yourself−−that You are there also,</text>

<text top="101" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">most advanced teachers and Masters have handed down. This is not the</text>

<text top="140" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">Yoga−−and we touch upon it here, not for the purpose of trying to explain</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">the scientific side of it to you, but merely in order that your minds may be</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">led to take up the idea and gradually manifest it in conscious realization.</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">There is quite a difference between the scientific, intellectual teaching of</text>

<text top="255" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">manner, and the methods of Raja Yoga, in which the Candidate is led by</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">degrees to a<i> consciousness</i> (outside of mere intellectual belief) of his real</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">nature and powers. We are following the latter plan, for this course is a</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">Course in<i> Raja</i> Yoga. We are aiming to present the matter to the mind in</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">such a manner that it may prepare the way for the dawning consciousness,</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">by brushing away the preconceived notions and prejudices, and allowing a</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="447" height="14" font="1">clean entrance for the new conception. Much that we have said in this</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">lesson may appear, on the one hand, like useless repetition, and, on the</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="487" height="14" font="1">other hand, like an incomplete presentation of the scientific side of the Yogi</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">teachings. But it will be found, in time, that the effect has been that the</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">mind of the student has undergone a change from the absorbing of the idea</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="456" height="14" font="1">of the Oneness of Life, and the Expansion of the Self. The Candidate is</text>

<text top="601" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">the time. The greater portion of mental work is done in this way, while you</text>

<text top="101" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">of the things which the word is intended to express. In the first place the</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">word &quot;Mind&quot; is used as synonymous with _Chitta_, or Mind−substance,</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="377" height="14" font="1">which is the Universal Mind Principle. From this _Chitta_,</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">Mind−substance, or Mind, all the material of the millions of personal minds</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="487" height="14" font="1">is obtained. The second meaning of the word &quot;Mind&quot; is that which we mean</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="442" height="14" font="1">when we speak of the &quot;mind&quot; of anyone, thereby meaning the mental</text>

<text top="466" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">teaches, as its basic principle, the Control of the Mind. It holds that the first</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">step toward Power consists in obtaining a control of one's own mind. It</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">holds that the internal world must be conquered before the outer world is</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">attacked. It holds that the &quot;I&quot; manifests itself in Will, and that that Will may</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">be used to manipulate, guide, govern and direct the mind of its owner, as</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">well as the physical world. It aims to clear away all mental rubbish, and</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">encumbrances−−to conduct a &quot;mental house−cleaning,&quot; as it were, and to</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">secure a clear, clean, healthy mind. Then it proceeds to control that mind</text>

<text top="313" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="3"><i>Raja Yoga</i> teaches that not only may power of this kind be secured, but that</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">a wonderful field of Knowledge is opened out through its practice. It holds</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">that when the concentrated mind is focused upon thing or subject, the true</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">nature and inner meaning, of, and concerning, that thing or subject will be</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="439" height="14" font="1">brought to view. The concentrated mind passes through the object or</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">subject just as the X−Ray passes through a block of wood, and the thing is</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">seen by the &quot;I&quot; as it _is_−−in truth−−and not as it had appeared before,</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="441" height="14" font="1">imperfectly and erroneously. Not only may the outside world be thus</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">explored, but the mental ray may be turned inward, and the secret places of</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">the mind explored. When it is remembered that the bit of mind that each</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">man possesses, is like a drop of the ocean which contains within its tiny</text>

<text top="543" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">perfectly the drop is to know perfectly the ocean, then we begin to see what</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="174" height="14" font="1">such a power really means.</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="418" height="14" font="1">Many in the Western world who have attained great results in the</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">intellectual and scientific fields of endeavor, have developed these powers</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="447" height="14" font="1">more or less unconsciously. Many great inventors are practical Yogis,</text>

<text top="370" left="72" width="387" height="14" font="1">proportions is the better plan, and one that we aim to follow.</text>

<text top="447" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">Before we can get the mind to do good work for us, we must first &quot;tame&quot; it,</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">and bring it to obedience to the Will of the &quot;I.&quot; The mind, as a rule, has</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="436" height="14" font="1">been allowed to run wild, and follow its own sweet will and desires,</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="439" height="14" font="1">without regard to anything else. Like a spoiled child or badly trained</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">domestic animal, it gets into much trouble, and is of very little pleasure,</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="440" height="14" font="1">comfort or use. The minds of many of us are like menageries of wild</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">animals, each pursuing the bent of its own nature, and going its own way.</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">We have the whole menagerie within us−−the tiger, the ape, the peacock,</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">the ass, the goose, the sheep the hyena, and all the rest. And we have been</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">letting these animals rule us. Even our Intellect is erratic, unstable, and like</text>

<text top="697" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">have trained their minds to obedience. They have asserted the Will over</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">their own minds, and learned Mastery and Power in that way. The average</text>

<text top="140" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">And this is the first thing to be learned in _Raja Yoga_−−this control of the</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="437" height="14" font="1">mind. Those who had hoped for some royal road to mastery, may be</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">disappointed, but there is only one way and that is to master and control the</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">mind by the Will. Otherwise it will run away when you most need it. And</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">so we shall give you some exercise designed to aid you in this direction.</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">The first exercise in<i> Raja Yoga</i> Is what is called<i> Pratyahara</i> or the art of</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">making the mind introspective or turned inward upon itself. It is the first</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">step toward mental control. It aims to turn the mind from going outward,</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">and gradually turning it inward upon itself or inner nature. The object is to</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="442" height="14" font="1">gain control of it by the Will. The following exercises will aid in that</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="61" height="14" font="1">direction:</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="90" height="14" font="1">EXERCISE I.</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">(a) Place yourself in a comfortable position, and so far as possible free from</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">outside disturbing influences. Make no violent effort to control the mind,</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">but rather allow it to run along for a while and exhaust its efforts. It will</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">take advantage of the opportunity, and will jump around like an unchained</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">monkey at first, until it gradually slows down and looks to you for orders. It</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">may take some time to tame down at first trial, but each time you try it will</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="430" height="14" font="1">come around to you in shorter time. The Yogis spend much time in</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">acquiring this mental peace and calm, and consider themselves well paid</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="36" height="14" font="1">for it.</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">(b) When the mind is well calmed down, and peaceful, fix the thought on</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">the &quot;I Am,&quot; as taught in our previous lessons. Picture the &quot;I&quot; as an entity</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="451" height="14" font="1">independent of the body; deathless; invulnerable; immortal; real. Then</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">think of it as independent of the body, and able to exist without its fleshly</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="441" height="14" font="1">covering. Meditate upon this for a time, and then gradually direct the</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="447" height="14" font="1">thought to the realization of the &quot;I&quot; as independent and superior to the</text>
<text top="735" left="72" width="445" height="14" font="1">mind, and controlling same. Go over the general ideas of the first two</text>

<text top="236" left="72" width="419" height="14" font="1">exercises in the first three lessons will have prepared you for this.</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">(d) The following is the most difficult of the variations or degrees of this</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">exercise, but the ability to perform it will come gradually. The exercise</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">consists in gradually shutting out all thought or impression of the outside</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="403" height="14" font="1">world; of the body; and of the thoughts themselves, the student</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="451" height="14" font="1">concentrating and meditating upon the word and idea &quot;I AM,&quot; the idea</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="408" height="14" font="1">being that he shall concentrate upon the idea of mere &quot;being&quot; or</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">&quot;existence,&quot; symbolized by the words &quot;I Am.&quot; Not &quot;I am _this_,&quot; or &quot;I am</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">_that_,&quot; or &quot;I<i> do</i> this,&quot; or &quot;I<i> think</i> that,&quot; but simply: &quot;I<i> AM</i>.&quot; This exercise</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">will focus the attention at the very centre of Being within oneself, and will</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">gather in all the mental energies, instead of allowing them to be scattered</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">upon outside things. A feeling of Peace, Strength, and Power will result, for</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="434" height="14" font="1">the affirmation, and the thought back of it, is the most powerful and</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">strongest that one may make, for it is a statement of Actual Being, and a</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">turning of the thought inward to that truth. Let the mind first dwell upon the</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="456" height="14" font="1">word &quot;I,&quot; identifying it with the Self, and then let it pass on to the word</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">&quot;AM,&quot; which signifies Reality, and Being. Then combine the two with the</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="442" height="14" font="1">meanings thereof, and the result a most powerful focusing of thought</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="286" height="14" font="1">inward, and most potent Statement of Being.</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">It is well to accompany the above exercises with a comfortable and easy</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">physical attitude, so as to prevent the distraction of the attention by the</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">body. In order to do this one should assume an easy attitude and then relax</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">every muscle, and take the tension from every nerve, until a perfect sense</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">of ease, comfort and relaxation is obtained. You should practice this until</text>
<text top="735" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">you have fully acquired it. It will be useful to you in many ways, besides</text>

<text top="159" left="72" width="416" height="14" font="1">The second step in<i> Raja Yoga</i> is what is known as _Dharana_, or</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">Concentration. This is a most wonderful idea in the direction of focusing</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">the mental forces, and may be cultivated to an almost incredible degree, but</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="445" height="14" font="1">all this requires work, time, and patience. But the student will be well</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">repaid for it. Concentration consists in the mind focusing upon a certain</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">subject, or object, and being held there for a time. This, at first thought</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">seems very easy, but a little practice will show how difficult it is to firmly</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">fix the attention and hold it there. It will have a tendency to waver, and</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">move to some other object or subject, and much practice will be needed in</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">order to hold it at the desired point. But practice will accomplish wonders,</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">as one may see by observing people who have acquired this faculty, and</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="427" height="14" font="1">who use it in their everyday life. But the following point should be</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">remembered. Many persons have acquired the faculty of concentrating their</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="444" height="14" font="1">attention, but have allowed it to become almost involuntary, and they</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">become a slave to it, forgetting themselves and everything else, and often</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">neglecting necessary affairs. This is the ignorant way of concentrating, and</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">those addicted to it become slaves to their habits, instead of masters of their</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">minds. They become day−dreamers, and absent−minded people, instead of</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">Masters. They are to be pitied as much as those who cannot concentrate at</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">all. The secret is in a mastery of the mind. The Yogis can concentrate at</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="441" height="14" font="1">will, and completely bury themselves in the subject before them, and</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">extract from it every item of interest, and can then pass the mind from the</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">thing at will, the same control being used in both cases. They do not allow</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="456" height="14" font="1">fits of abstraction, or &quot;absent−mindedness&quot; to come upon them, nor are</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">they day−dreamers. On the contrary they are very wide awake individuals;</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">close observers; clear thinkers; correct reasoners. They are masters of their</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">minds, not slaves to their moods. The ignorant concentrator buries himself</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">in the object or subject, and allows it to master and absorb himself, while</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="431" height="14" font="1">the trained Yogi thinker asserts the &quot;I,&quot; and then directs his mind to</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">concentrate upon the subject or object, keeping it well under control and in</text>

<text top="370" left="72" width="124" height="14" font="1">(1) The thing itself.</text>

<text top="601" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">Concentration is a focusing of the mind. And this focusing of the mind</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="434" height="14" font="1">requires a focusing, or bringing to a center, of the Will. The mind is</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">concentrated because the Will is focused upon the object. The mind flows</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">into the mould made by the Will. The above exercises are designed not</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">only to accustom the mind to the obedience and direction of the Will, but</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">also tend to accustom the Will to command. We speak of strengthening the</text>

<text top="82" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">&quot;I,&quot; but our imperfectly developed mind does not recognize this tact. We</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">are like young elephants that do not recognize their own strength, but allow</text>

<text top="197" left="72" width="446" height="14" font="1">We shall have much to say touching the Will, in these lessons and the</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">student should give the matter his careful attention. Let him look around</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">him, and he will see that the great difference between the men who have</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">stepped forward from the ranks, and those who remain huddled up in the</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">crowd, consists in Determination and Will. As Buxton has well said: &quot;The</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">longer I live, the more certain I am that the great difference between men,</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">the feeble and the powerful; the great and the insignificant; is Energy and</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">Invincible Determination.&quot; And he might have added that the thing behind</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="338" height="14" font="1">that &quot;energy and invincible determination&quot; was Will.</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">The writers and thinkers of all ages have recognized the wonderful and</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">transcendent importance of the Will. Tennyson sings: &quot;O living Will thou</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="438" height="14" font="1">shalt endure when all that seems shall suffer shock.&quot; Oliver Wendell</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">Holmes says: &quot;The seat of the Will seems to vary with the organ through</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">which it is manifested; to transport itself to different parts of the brain, as</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">we may wish to recall a picture, a phrase, a melody; to throw its force on</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">the muscles or the intellectual processes. Like the general−in−chief, its</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">place is everywhere in the field of action. It is the least like an instrument</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="439" height="14" font="1">of any of our faculties; the farthest removed from our conceptions of</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">mechanism and matter, as we commonly define them.&quot; Holmes was correct</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="445" height="14" font="1">in his idea, but faulty in his details. The Will does not change its seat,</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">which is always in the center of the Ego, but the Will forces the mind to all</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">parts, and in all directions, and it directs the<i> Prana</i> or vital force likewise.</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">The Will is indeed the general−in−chief, but it does not rush to the various</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">points of action, but sends its messengers and couriers there to carry out its</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">orders. Buxton has said: &quot;The Will will do anything that can be done in this</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="448" height="14" font="1">world. And no talents, no circumstances, no opportunities will make a</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">two−legged creature a Man without it.&quot; Ik Marvel truly says: &quot;Resolve is</text>

<text top="159" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">The great obstacle to the proper use of the Will, in the case of the majority</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="456" height="14" font="1">of people, is the lack of ability to focus the attention. The Yogis clearly</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">understand this point, and many of the<i> Raja Yoga</i> exercises which are given</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">to the students by the teachers, are designed to overcome this difficulty.</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">Attention is the outward evidence of the Will. As a French writer has said:</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">&quot;The attention is subject to the superior authority of the Ego. I yield it, or I</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">withhold it, as I please. I direct it in turn to several points. I concentrate it</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">upon each point as long as my Will can stand the effort.&quot; Prof. James has</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">said: &quot;The essential achievement of the Will, when it is most voluntary, is</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">to attend to a difficult object, and hold it fast before the mind. Effort of</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">Attention is the essential phenomenon of the Will.&quot; And Prof. Halleck says:</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="439" height="14" font="1">&quot;The first step toward the development of Will lies in the exercise of</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="452" height="14" font="1">Attention. Ideas grow in distinctness and motor−power as we attend to</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">them. If we take two ideas of the same intensity and center the attention</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">upon one, we shall notice how much it grows in power.&quot; Prof. Sully says:</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">&quot;Attention may be roughly defined as the active self−direction of the mind</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">to any object which presents itself at the moment.&quot; The word &quot;Attention&quot; is</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">derived from two Latin words, _ad tendere_, meaning &quot;to stretch towards,&quot;</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">and this is just what the Yogis know it to be. By means of their psychic or</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">clairvoyant sight, they see the thought of the attentive person stretched out</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">toward the object attended to, like a sharp wedge, the point of which is</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">focused upon the object under consideration, the entire force of the thought</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">being concentrated at that point. This is true not only when the person is</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">considering an object, but when he is earnestly impressing his ideas upon</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">another, or upon some task to be accomplished. Attention means reaching</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="307" height="14" font="1">the mind out to and focusing it upon something.</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">The trained Will exhibits itself in a tenacious Attention, and this Attention</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="427" height="14" font="1">is one of the signs of the trained Will. The student must not hastily</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">conclude that this kind of Attention is a common faculty among men. On</text>
<text top="735" left="72" width="440" height="14" font="1">the contrary it is quite rare, and is seen only among those of &quot;strong&quot;</text>

<text top="101" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">and hold it there. Of course the trained occultist is able to throw interest</text>

<text top="159" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">possession of the average man. Voluntary Attention is rare, and is found</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">only among strong characters. But it may be cultivated and grown, until he</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">who has scarcely a shade of it to−day, in time may become a giant. It is all</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="252" height="14" font="1">a matter of practice, exercise, and Will.</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">It is difficult to say too much in favor of the development of the faculty of</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="439" height="14" font="1">tenacious Attention. One possessing this developed faculty is able to</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">accomplish far more than even a much &quot;brighter&quot; man who lacks it. And</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">the best way to train the Attention, under the direction of the Will, is to</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">practice upon<i> uninteresting</i> objects, and ideas, holding them before the</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">mind until they begin to assume an Interest. This is difficult at first, but the</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="425" height="14" font="1">task soon begins to take on a pleasant aspect, for one finds that his</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">Will−power and Attention are growing, and he feels himself acquiring a</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">Force and Power that were lacking before−−he realizes that he is growing</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">Stronger. Charles Dickens said that the secret of his success consisted in his</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="448" height="14" font="1">developing a faculty of throwing his entire Attention into whatever he</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">happened to be doing at the moment and then being able to turn that same</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">degree of Attention to the next thing coming before him for consideration.</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="447" height="14" font="1">He was like a man behind a great searchlight, which was successively</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">turned upon point after point, illuminating each in turn. The &quot;I&quot; is the man</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">behind the light, and the Will is the reflector, the light being the Attention.</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="456" height="14" font="1">This discussion of Will and Attention may seem somewhat &quot;dry&quot; to the</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">student, but that is all the more reason that he should attend to it. It is the</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">secret that lies at the basis of the Science of _Raja Yoga_, and the Yogi</text>

<text top="507" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">In our last lesson we called your attention to the fact that the Yogis devote</text>
<text top="526" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">considerable time and practice to the acquirement of Concentration. And</text>
<text top="545" left="72" width="452" height="14" font="1">we also had something to say regarding the relation of Attention to the</text>
<text top="564" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">subject of Concentration. In this lesson we shall have more to say on the</text>
<text top="583" left="72" width="452" height="14" font="1">subject of Attention, for it is one of the important things relating to the</text>
<text top="603" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">practice of _Raja Yoga_, and the Yogis insist upon their students practicing</text>
<text top="622" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">systematically to develop and cultivate the faculty. Attention lies at the</text>
<text top="641" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">base of Will−power, and the cultivation of one makes easy the exercise of</text>

<text top="82" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">cultivation of Attention, is occasioned by the relation of that subject to the</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="414" height="14" font="1">use of the mind in certain directions as will appear fully later on.</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">In order to let you know that we are not advancing some peculiar theory of</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">the Yogis, which may not be in harmony with modern Western Science, we</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">give you in this article a number of quotations, from Western writers and</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">thinkers, touching upon this important faculty of the mind, so that you may</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">see that the West and East agree upon this main point, however different</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">may be their explanations of the fact, or their use of the power gained by</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="178" height="14" font="1">the cultivation of Attention.</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">As we said in our last lesson, the word Attention is derived from two Latin</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">words &quot;_ad tendere_,&quot; meaning &quot;to stretch toward,&quot; which is really what</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="450" height="14" font="1">Attention is. The &quot;I&quot; wills that the mind be focused on some particular</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">object or thing, and the mind obeys and &quot;stretches toward&quot; that object or</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">thing, focusing its entire energy upon it, observing every detail, dissecting,</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="436" height="14" font="1">analyzing, consciously and sub−consciously, drawing to itself every</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">possible bit of information regarding it, both from within and from without.</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">We cannot lay too much stress upon the acquirement of this great faculty,</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">or rather, the development of it, for it is necessary for the intelligent study</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="88" height="14" font="1">of<i> Raja Yoga</i>.</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">In order to bring out the importance of the subject, suppose we start in by</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">actually giving our Attention to the subject of Attention, and see how much</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="452" height="14" font="1">more there is in it than we had thought. We shall be well repaid for the</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="292" height="14" font="1">amount of time and trouble expended upon it.</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">Attention has been defined as a focusing of consciousness, or, if one prefers</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">the form of expression, as &quot;detention in consciousness.&quot; In the first case, we</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">may liken it to the action of the sun−glass through which the sun's rays are</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="443" height="14" font="1">concentrated upon an object, the result being that the heat is gathered</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">together at a small given point, the intensity of the same being raised many</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">degrees until the heat is sufficient to burn a piece of wood, or evaporate</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="487" height="14" font="1">water. If the rays were not focused, the same rays and heat would have been</text>
<text top="735" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">scattered over a large surface, and the effect and power lessened. And so it</text>

<text top="274" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">Another writer upon the subject has said that &quot;Attention is so essentially</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">necessary to understanding, that without some degree of it the ideas and</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="441" height="14" font="1">perceptions that pass through the mind seem to leave no trace behind</text>

<text top="370" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="3"><i>Hamilton</i> has said: &quot;An act of attention, that is, an act of concentration,</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="440" height="14" font="1">seems thus necessary to every exertion of consciousness, as a certain</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">contraction of the pupil is requisite to every exertion of vision. Attention</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">then is to consciousness what the contraction of the pupil is to sight, or, to</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">the eye of the mind what the microscope or telescope is to the bodily eye. It</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="328" height="14" font="1">constitutes the better half of all intellectual power.&quot;</text>

<text top="543" left="72" width="411" height="14" font="1">difference which exists between minds of different individuals.&quot;</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="3"><i>Butler</i> gives us this important testimony: &quot;The most important intellectual</text>

<text top="82" left="72" width="444" height="14" font="1">wherewith anything strikes the mind, is generally in proportion to the</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">degree of attention bestowed upon it. Moreover, the great art of memory is</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="393" height="14" font="1">attention, and inattentive people always have bad memories.&quot;</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">There are two general kinds of Attention. The first is the Attention directed</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="429" height="14" font="1">within the mind upon mental objects and concepts. The other is the</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">Attention directed outward upon objects external to ourselves. The same</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="286" height="14" font="1">general rules and laws apply to both equally.</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">Likewise there may be drawn another distinction and division of attention</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">into two classes, _viz._, Attenion attracted by some impression coming into</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="449" height="14" font="1">consciousness without any conscious effort of the Will−−this is called</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="438" height="14" font="1">Involuntary Attention, for the Attention and Interest is caught by the</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">attractiveness or novelty of the object. Attention directed to some object by</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">an effort of the Will, is called Voluntary Attention. Involuntary Attention is</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">quite common, and requires no special training. In fact, the lower animals,</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">and young children seem to have a greater share of it than do adult men. A</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">great percentage of men and women never get beyond this stage to any</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">marked degree. On the other hand, Voluntary Attention requires effort,</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="444" height="14" font="1">will, and determination−−a certain mental training, that is beyond the</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="437" height="14" font="1">majority of people, for they will not &quot;take the trouble&quot; to direct their</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">attention in this way. Voluntary Attention is the mark of the student and</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">other thoughtful men. They focus their minds on objects that do not yield</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="487" height="14" font="1">immediate interest or pleasure, in order that they may learn and accomplish.</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">The careless person will not thus fasten his Attention, at least not more than</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">a moment or so, for his Involuntary Attention is soon attracted by some</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="432" height="14" font="1">passing object of no matter how trifling a nature, and the Voluntary</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">Attention disappears and is forgotten. Voluntary Attention is developed by</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">practice and perseverance, and is well worth the trouble, for nothing in the</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="293" height="14" font="1">mental world is accomplished without its use.</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">The Attention does not readily fasten itself to uninteresting objects, and,</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">unless interest can be created it requires a considerable degree of Voluntary</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">Attention in order that the mind may be fastened upon such an object. And,</text>
<text top="735" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">more than this, even if the ordinary attention is attracted it will soon waver,</text>

<text top="63" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">unless there is some interesting change in the aspect of the object, that will</text>
<text top="82" left="72" width="445" height="14" font="1">give the attention a fresh hold of interest, or unless some new quality,</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">characteristic or property manifests itself in the object. This fact occurs</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="437" height="14" font="1">because the mind mechanism has not been trained to bear prolonged</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">Voluntary Attention, and, in fact, the physical brain is not accustomed to</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="370" height="14" font="1">the task, although it may be so trained by patient practice.</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">It has been noticed by investigators that the Attention may be rested and</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">freshened, either by withdrawing the Voluntary Attention from the object,</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="448" height="14" font="1">and allowing the Attention to manifest along Involuntary lines toward</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="447" height="14" font="1">passing objects, etc.; or, on the other hand, by directing the Voluntary</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="438" height="14" font="1">Attention into a new field of observation−−toward some new object.</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">Sometimes one plan will seem to give the best results, and again the other</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="135" height="14" font="1">will seem preferable.</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">We have called your attention to the fact that Interest develops Attention,</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">and holds it fixed, while an uninteresting object or subject requires a much</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">greater effort and application. This fact is apparent to anyone. A common</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">illustration may be found in the matter of reading a book. Nearly everyone</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">will give his undivided attention to some bright, thrilling story, while but</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">few are able to use sufficient Voluntary Attention to master the pages of</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">some scientific work. But, right here, we wish to call your attention to the</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">other side of the case, which is another example of the fact that Truth is</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="155" height="14" font="1">composed of paradoxes.</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">Just as Interest develops Attention, so it is a truth that Attention develops</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">Interest. If one will take the trouble to give a little Voluntary Attention to</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="451" height="14" font="1">an object, he will soon find that a little perseverance will bring to light</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">points of Interest in the object. Things before unseen and unsuspected, are</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">quickly brought to light. And many new phases, and aspects of the subject</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="487" height="14" font="1">or object are seen, each one of which, in turn, becomes an object of Interest.</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">This is a fact not so generally known, and one that it will be well for you to</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">remember, and to use in practice.<i> Look</i> for the interesting features of an</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">uninteresting thing, and they will appear to your view, and before long the</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">uninteresting object will have changed into a thing having many−sided</text>
<text top="735" left="72" width="57" height="14" font="1">interests.</text>

<text top="63" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">Voluntary Attention is one of the signs of a developed Will. That is, of a</text>
<text top="82" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">mind that has been well trained by the Will, for the Will is always strong,</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="449" height="14" font="1">and it is the mind that has to be trained, not the Will. And on the other</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">hand, one of the best ways to train the mind by the Will, is by practice in</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="448" height="14" font="1">Voluntary Attention. So you see how the rule works both ways. Some</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="452" height="14" font="1">Western psychologists have even advanced theories that the Voluntary</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">Attention is the<i> only</i> power of the Will, and that that power is sufficient, for</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">if the Attention be firmly fixed, and held upon an object the mind will &quot;do</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="452" height="14" font="1">the rest.&quot; We do not agree with this school of philosophers, but merely</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="416" height="14" font="1">mention the fact as an illustration of the importance attributed by</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="330" height="14" font="1">psychologists to this matter of Voluntary Attention.</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">A man of a strongly developed Attention often accomplishes far more than</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">some much brighter man who lacks it. Voluntary Attention and Application</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">is a very good substitute for Genius, and often accomplishes far more in the</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="58" height="14" font="1">long run.</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">Voluntary Attention is the fixing of the mind earnestly and intently upon</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">some particular object, at the same time shutting out from consciousness</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="396" height="14" font="1">other objects pressing for entrance.<i> Hamilton</i> has defined it as</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">&quot;consciousness voluntarily applied under its law of limitations to some</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">determinate object.&quot; The same writer goes on to state that &quot;the greater the</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">number of objects to which our consciousness is simultaneously extended,</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="441" height="14" font="1">the smaller is the intensity with which it is able to consider each, and</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">consequently the less vivid and distinct will be the information it contains</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">of the several objects. When our interest in any particular object is excited,</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">and when we wish to obtain all the knowledge concerning it in our power,</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">it behooves us to limit our consideration to that object to the exclusion of</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="50" height="14" font="1">others.&quot;</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">The human mind has the power of attending to only one object at a time,</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="450" height="14" font="1">although it is able to pass from one object to another with a marvelous</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">degree of speed, so rapidly, in fact, that some have held that it could grasp</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">several things at once. But the best authorities, Eastern and Western, hold</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">to the &quot;single idea&quot; theory as being correct. On this point we may quote a</text>
<text top="735" left="72" width="100" height="14" font="1">few authorities.</text>

<text top="82" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">attention to two different objects at the same time.&quot; And<i> Holland</i> states that</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">&quot;Two thoughts, however closely related to one another, cannot be presumed</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">to exist at the same time.&quot; And<i> Lewes</i> has told us that &quot;The nature of our</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">organism prevents our having more than one aspect of an object at each</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">instant presented to consciousness.&quot;<i> Whateley</i> says: &quot;The best philosophers</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">are agreed that the mind cannot actually attend to more than one thing at a</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">time, but, when it appears to be doing so it is really shifting with prodigious</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="347" height="14" font="1">rapidity backward and forward from one to the other.&quot;</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">By giving a concentrated Voluntary Attention to an object, we not only are</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">able to see and think about it with the greatest possible degree of clearness,</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">but the mind has a tendency, under such circumstances, to bring into the</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">field of consciousness all the different ideas associated in our memory with</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">that object or subject, and to build around the object or subject a mass of</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">associated facts and information. And at the same time the Attention given</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">the subject makes more vivid and clear all that we learn about the thing at</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">the time, and, in fact, all that we may afterwards learn about it. It seems to</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="303" height="14" font="1">cut a channel, through which knowledge flows.</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">Attention magnifies and increases the powers of perception, and greatly</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="439" height="14" font="1">aids the exercise of the perceptive faculties. By &quot;paying attention&quot; to</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">something seen or heard, one is enabled to observe the details of the thing</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="410" height="14" font="1">seen or heard, and where the inattentive mind acquires say three</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">impressions the attentive mind absorbs three times three, or perhaps three</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="447" height="14" font="1">times &quot;three times three,&quot; or twenty−seven. And, as we have just said,</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">Attention brings into play the powers of association, and gives us the &quot;loose</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="450" height="14" font="1">end&quot; of an almost infinite chain of associated facts, stored away in our</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">memory, forming new combinations of facts which we had never grouped</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">together before, and bring out into the field of consciousness all the many</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">scraps of information regarding the thing to which we are giving attention.</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">The proof of this is within the experience of everyone. Where is the one</text>

<text top="716" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">flow of facts regarding the matter in hand was passing through his mind.</text>

<text top="82" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">and thus create new knowledge.<i> Gibbon</i> tells us that after he gave a brief</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">glance and consideration to a new subject, he suspended further work upon</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">it, and allowed his mind (under concentrated attention) to bring forth all his</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">associated knowledge regarding the subject, after which he renewed the</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="266" height="14" font="1">task with increased power and efficiency.</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">The more one's attention is fixed upon a subject under consideration, the</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">deeper is the impression which the subject leaves upon the mind. And the</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">easier will it be for him to afterwards pursue the same train of thought and</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="37" height="14" font="1">work.</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">Attention is a prerequisite of good memory, and in fact there can be no</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="446" height="14" font="1">memory at all unless some degree of attention is given. The degree of</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">memory depends upon the degree of attention and interest. And when it is</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="487" height="14" font="1">considered that the work of today is made efficient by the memory of things</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">learned yesterday, the day before yesterday, and so on, it is seen that the</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="428" height="14" font="1">degree of attention given today regulates the quality of the work of</text>

<text top="466" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">attention, or, at least, that the two seem to run together. Some writer has</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="400" height="14" font="1">said that &quot;possibly the best definition of genius is the power of</text>

<text top="82" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">continually before the mind. And others have added that such a course will</text>

<text top="159" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">The degree of Attention cultivated by a man is the degree of his capacity</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">for intellectual work. As we have said, the &quot;great&quot; men of all walks of life</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">have developed this faculty to a wonderful degree, and many of them seem</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">to get results &quot;intuitively,&quot; whereas, in truth, they obtain them by reason of</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">their concentrated power of Attention, which enables them to see right into</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">the center of a subject or proposition−−and all around it, back and front,</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="421" height="14" font="1">and all sides, in a space of time incredible to the man who has not</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">cultivated this mighty power. Men who have devoted much attention to</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="446" height="14" font="1">some special line of work or research, are able to act almost as if they</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">possessed &quot;second sight,&quot; providing the subject is within their favorite field</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">of endeavor. Attention quickens every one of the faculties−−the reasoning</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">faculties−−the senses−−the deriding qualities−−the analytical faculties, and</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">so on, each being given a &quot;fine edge&quot; by their use under a concentrated</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="64" height="14" font="1">Attention.</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">And, on the other hand, there is no surer indication of a weak mind than the</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">deficiency in Attention. This weakness may arise from illness or physical</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="420" height="14" font="1">weakness reacting upon the brain, in which case the trouble is but</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">temporary. Or it may arise from a lack of mental development. Imbeciles</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="438" height="14" font="1">and idiots have little or no Attention. The great French psychologist,</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">_Luys_, speaking of this fact, says &quot;Imbeciles and idiots see badly, hear</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="442" height="14" font="1">badly, feel badly, and their sensorium is, in consequence, in a similar</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">condition of sensitive poverty. Its impressionability for the things of the</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">external world is at a minimum, its sensibility weak, and consequently, it is</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="487" height="14" font="1">difficult to provoke the physiological condition necessary for the absorption</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="177" height="14" font="1">of the external impression.&quot;</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">In old age the Attention is the first faculty to show signs of decay. Some</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">authorities have held that the Memory was the first faculty to be affected by</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">the approach of old age, but this is incorrect, for it is a matter of common</text>
<text top="735" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">experience that the aged manifest a wonderfully clear memory of events</text>

<text top="82" left="72" width="456" height="14" font="1">so poor is because their failing powers of Attention has prevented them</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">from receiving strong, clear mental impressions, and as is the impression so</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">is the memory. Their early impressions having been clear and strong, are</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="431" height="14" font="1">easily recalled, while their later ones, being weak, are recalled with</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">difficulty. If the Memory were at fault, it would be difficult for them to</text>

<text top="217" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">But we must stop quoting examples and authorities, and urging upon you</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">the importance of the faculty of Attention. If you do not now realize it, it is</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">because you have not given the subject the Attention that you should have</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="380" height="14" font="1">exercised, and further repetition would not remedy matters.</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">Admitting the importance of Attention, from the psychological point of</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="450" height="14" font="1">view, not to speak of the occult side of the subject, is it not a matter of</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="487" height="14" font="1">importance for you to start in to cultivate that faculty? We think so. And the</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">only way to cultivate any mental or physical part or faculty is to Exercise it.</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">Exercise &quot;uses up&quot; a muscle, or mental faculty, but the organism makes</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">haste to rush to the scene additional material−−cell−stuff, nerve force, etc.,</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">to repair the waste, and it always sends a little more than is needed. And</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">this &quot;little more,&quot; continually accruing and increasing, is what increases the</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">muscles and brain centers. And improved and strengthened brain centers</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="340" height="14" font="1">give the mind better instruments with which to work.</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">One of the first things to do in the cultivation of Attention is to learn to</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="451" height="14" font="1">think of, and do, one thing at a time. Acquiring the &quot;knack&quot; or habit of</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">attending closely to the things before us, and then passing on to the next</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="439" height="14" font="1">and treating it in the same way, is most conducive to success, and its</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">practice is the best exercise for the cultivation of the faculty of Attention.</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">And on the contrary, there is nothing more harmful from the point of view</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">of successful performance−−and nothing that will do more to destroy the</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">power of giving Attention−−than the habit of trying to do one thing while</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="446" height="14" font="1">thinking of another. The thinking part of the mind, and the acting part</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="256" height="14" font="1">should work together, not in opposition.</text>

<text top="63" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">_Dr. Beattie_, speaking of this subject, tells us &quot;It is a matter of no small</text>
<text top="82" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">importance that we acquire the habit of doing only one thing at a time; by</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">which I mean that while attending to any one object, our thoughts ought not</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">to wander to another.&quot; And<i> Granville</i> adds, &quot;A frequent cause of failure in</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="447" height="14" font="1">the faculty of Attention is striving to think of more than one thing at a</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">time.&quot; And<i> Kay</i> quotes, approvingly, a writer who says: &quot;She did things</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">easily, because she attended to them in the doing. When she made bread,</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">she thought of the bread, and not of the fashion of her next dress, or of her</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">partner at the last dance.&quot; _Lord Chesterfield said,_ &quot;There is time enough</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">for everything in the course of the day, if you do but one thing at a time;</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="448" height="14" font="1">but there is not time enough in the year if you try to do two things at a</text>

<text top="313" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">To attain the best results one should practice concentrating upon the task</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">before him, shutting out, so far as possible, every other idea or thought.</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="440" height="14" font="1">One should even forget self−−personality−−in such cases, as there is</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="408" height="14" font="1">nothing more destructive of good thinking than to allow morbid</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">self−consciousness to intrude. One does best when he &quot;forgets himself&quot; in</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">his work, and sinks his personality in the creative work. The &quot;earnest&quot; man</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="424" height="14" font="1">or woman is the one who sinks personality in the desired result, or</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">performance of the task undertaken. The actor, or preacher, or orator, or</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">writer, must lose sight of himself to get the best results. Keep the Attention</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="407" height="14" font="1">fixed on the thing before you, and let the self take care of itself.</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">In connection with the above, we may relate an anecdote of<i> Whateley</i> that</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">may be interesting in connection with the consideration of this subject of</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">&quot;losing one's self&quot; in the task. He was asked for a recipe for &quot;bashfulness,&quot;</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">and replied that the person was bashful simply because he was thinking of</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">himself and the impression he was making. His recipe was that the young</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">man should think of others−−of the pleasure he could give them−−and in</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">that way he would forget all about himself. The prescription is said to have</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="405" height="14" font="1">effected the cure. The same authority has written, &quot;Let both the</text>

<text top="101" left="72" width="429" height="14" font="1">The same writer, _Whateley_, seems to have made quite a study of</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">Attention and has given us some interesting information on its details. The</text>

<text top="178" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">many people find that they can best attend to any serious matter when they</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">are occupied with something else which requires a little, and but a little,</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">attention, such as working with the needle, cutting open paper leaves, or,</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">for want of some such employment, fiddling anyhow with the fingers.&quot; He</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="446" height="14" font="1">does not give the reason for this, and at first sight it might seem like a</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">contradiction of the &quot;one thing at a time&quot; idea. But a closer examination</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">will show us that the minor work (the cutting leaves, etc.) is in the nature of</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">an involuntary or automatic movement, inasmuch as it requires little or no</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="433" height="14" font="1">voluntary attention, and seems to &quot;do itself.&quot; It does not take off the</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="440" height="14" font="1">Attention from the main subject, but perhaps acts to catch the &quot;waste</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">Attention&quot; that often tries to divide the Attention from some voluntary act</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">to another. The habit mind may be doing one thing, while the Attention is</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">fixed on another. For instance, one may be writing with his attention firmly</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">fixed upon the thought he wishes to express, while at the time his hand is</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="456" height="14" font="1">doing the writing, apparently with no attention being given it. But, let a</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">boy, or person unaccustomed to writing, try to express his thoughts in this</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">way, and you will find that he is hampered in the flow of his thoughts by</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">the fact that he has to give much attention to the mechanical act of writing.</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="426" height="14" font="1">In the same way, the beginner on the typewriter finds it difficult to</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">compose to the machine, while the experienced typist finds the mechanical</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">movements no hindrance whatever to the flow of thought and focusing of</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="449" height="14" font="1">Attention; in fact, many find that they can compose much better while</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">using the typewriter than they can by dictating to a stenographer. We think</text>

<text top="140" left="72" width="382" height="14" font="1">reduce the thing to its simplest parts−−analyze it as far as is</text>

<text top="255" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">covered the entire field. Then, when you have exhausted the object, take a</text>

<text top="63" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">_Exercise II._ This exercise is but a variation of the first one. It consists in</text>
<text top="82" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">entering a room, and taking a hasty glance around, and then walking out,</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">and afterward writing down the number of things that you have observed,</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">with a description of each. You will be surprised to observe how many</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="424" height="14" font="1">things you have missed at first sight, and how you will improve in</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">observation by a little practice. This exercise, also, may be improved by the</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">assistance of a friend, as related in our last exercise. It is astonishing how</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">many details one may observe and remember, after a little practice. It is</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">related of Houdin, the French conjurer, that he improved and developed his</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="438" height="14" font="1">faculty of Attention and Memory by playing this game with a young</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="445" height="14" font="1">relative. They would pass by a shop window, taking a hasty, attentive</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">glance at its contents. Then they would go around the corner and compare</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">notes. At first they could remember only a few prominent articles−−that is,</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">their Attention could grasp only a few. But as they developed by practice,</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">they found that they could observe and remember a vast number of things</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">and objects in the window. And, at last, it is related that Houdin could pass</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">rapidly before any large shop window, bestowing upon it but one hasty</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">glance, and then tell the names of, and closely describe, nearly every object</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">in plain sight in the window. The feat was accomplished by the fact that the</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">cultivated Attention enabled Houdin to fasten upon his mind a vivid mental</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">image of the window and its contents, and then he was able to describe the</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="308" height="14" font="1">articles one by one from the picture in his mind.</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">Houdin taught his son to develop Attention by a simple exercise which may</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">be interesting and of value to you. He would lay down a domino before the</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">boy−−a five−four, for example. He would require the boy to tell him the</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">combined number at once, without allowing him to stop to count the spots,</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">one by one. &quot;Nine&quot; the boy would answer after a moment's hesitation. Then</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">another domino, a three−four, would be added. &quot;That makes sixteen,&quot; cried</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">the boy. Two dominoes at a time was the second day's task. The next day,</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="487" height="14" font="1">three was the standard. The next day, four, and so on, until the boy was able</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">to handle twelve dominoes−−that is to say, give instantaneously the total</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="438" height="14" font="1">number of spots on twelve dominoes, after a single glance. This was</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">Attention, in earnest, and shows what practice will do to develop a faculty.</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">The result was shown by the wonderful powers of observation, memory</text>
<text top="735" left="72" width="441" height="14" font="1">and attention, together with instantaneous mental action, that the boy</text>

<text top="82" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">had powers of observation, etc., that seemed little short of miraculous. And</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">yet it is related that he had poor attention, and deficient memory to begin</text>

<text top="197" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">played or not, and all the circumstances attending upon them. The same is</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">true of chess players, who observe every move and can relate the whole</text>

<text top="255" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">woman may pass another woman on the street, and without seeming to give</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">her more than a careless glance, may be able to relate in detail every feature</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="417" height="14" font="1">of the other woman's apparel, including its color, texture, style of</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">fashioning, probable price of the material, etc., etc. And a mere man would</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">have noticed scarcely anything about it−−because he would not have given</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">it any attention. But how soon would that man learn to equal his sister in</text>

<text top="389" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">success depended upon it, or if his speculative instinct was called into play</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">by a wager with some friend as to who could remember the most about a</text>

<text top="485" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">But we forget that the Attention may be developed and cultivated, and we</text>

<text top="447" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">thousands of other everyday objects. The results are almost marvelous. In</text>

<text top="507" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">Man gains his knowledge of the outside world through his senses. And,</text>
<text top="526" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">consequently, many of us are in the habit of thinking of these senses as if</text>

<text top="466" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">dominancy of the &quot;I&quot; over the faculties and emotions, etc. The second step,</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">or way, lies in the Yogi, once having asserted the mastery, beginning to</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">develop and perfect the Mental instrument, so as to get better work and</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">returns from it. In this way he increases his kingdom and is Master over a</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="137" height="14" font="1">much larger territory.</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="432" height="14" font="1">In order for one to gain knowledge, it is necessary to use to the best</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">advantage the mental instruments and tools that he finds at his disposal.</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">And again, one must develop and improve such tools−−put a keen edge</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">upon them, etc. Not only does one gain a great benefit from a development</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">of the faculties of perception, but he also acquires an additional benefit</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">from the training of the whole mind arising from the mental discipline and</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">training resulting from the former exercises, etc. In our previous lessons we</text>

<text top="101" left="72" width="444" height="14" font="1">students to lose interest in the work. If they only knew just what such</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">development would lead to they would gladly follow our suggestions in the</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">matter. Every one of the ideas and exercises given by us are intended to</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">lead up to the strengthening of the Mind, and the attainment of powers and</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">the unfoldment of faculties. There is no royal road to Raja Yoga, but the</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">student will be well repaid for the work of climbing the hill of Attainment.</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">In view of the above, let us examine the question of The Senses. Through</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="446" height="14" font="1">the doors of the senses Man receives all his information regarding the</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">outside world. If he keeps these doors but half open, or crowded up with</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">obstacles and rubbish, he may expect to receive but few messages from</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">outside. But if he keeps his doorways clear, and clean, he will obtain the</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="178" height="14" font="1">best that is passing his way.</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">If one were born without sense−organs−−no matter how good a Mind he</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">might have−−he would be compelled to live his life in a dreamy plant−life</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">stage of existence, with little or no consciousness. The Mind would be like</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="446" height="14" font="1">a seed in the earth, that for some reason was prevented from growing.</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">One may object that the highest ideas do not come to us through the senses,</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">but the reply is that the things obtained through the senses are the &quot;raw</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">material&quot; upon which the mind works, and fashions the beautiful things that</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">it is able to produce in its highest stages. Just as is the body dependent for</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">growth upon the nourishment taken into it, so is the mind dependent for</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="442" height="14" font="1">growth upon the impressions received from the Universe−−and these</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">impressions come largely through the senses. It may be objected to that we</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">know many things that we have not received through our senses. But, does</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">the objector include the impressions that came through his senses in some</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">previous existence, and which have been impressed upon his instinctive</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">mind, or soul−memory? It is true that there are higher senses than those</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">usually recognized, but Nature insists upon one learning the lessons of the</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="327" height="14" font="1">lower grades before attempting those of the higher.</text>

<text top="63" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">Do not forget that all that we know we have &quot;worked for.&quot; There is nothing</text>
<text top="82" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">that comes to the idler, or shirker. What we know is merely the result of</text>

<text top="159" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">So it will be seen that the Yogi idea that one should develop all parts of the</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="451" height="14" font="1">Mind is strictly correct, if one will take the trouble to examine into the</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">matter. A man sees and knows but very little of what is going on about him.</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">His limitations are great. His powers of vision report only a few vibrations</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="438" height="14" font="1">of light, while below and above the scale lie an infinity of vibrations</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="449" height="14" font="1">unknown to him. The same is true of the powers of hearing, for only a</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="431" height="14" font="1">comparatively small portion of the sound−waves reach the Mind of</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="366" height="14" font="1">Man−−even some of the animals hear more than he does.</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">If a man had only one sense he would obtain but a one−sense idea of the</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">outside world. If another sense is added his knowledge is doubled. And so</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">on. The best proof of the relation between increased sense perception and</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">development is had in the study of the evolution of animal forms. In the</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">early stages of life the organism has only the sense of feeling−−and very</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">dim at that−−and a faint sense of taste. Then developed smell, hearing and</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">sight, each marking a distinct advance in the scale of life, for a new world</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="434" height="14" font="1">has been opened out to the advancing forms of life. And, when man</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">develops new senses−−and this is before the race−−he will be a much wiser</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="115" height="14" font="1">and greater being.</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">Carpenter, many years ago, voiced a thought that will be familiar to those</text>

<text top="581" left="72" width="447" height="14" font="1">new senses. He said: &quot;It does not seem at all improbable that there are</text>

<text top="121" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">much more than barely possible; ought we not to think it almost certain?&quot;</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">Another writer. Prof. Masson, has said: &quot;If a new sense or two were added</text>

<text top="236" left="72" width="136" height="14" font="1">of these new senses.&quot;</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">But not only is this true, but Man may increase his powers of knowledge</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="487" height="14" font="1">and experience if he will but develop the senses he has to a higher degree of</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">efficiency, instead of allowing them to remain comparatively atrophied.</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="273" height="14" font="1">And toward this end, this lesson is written.</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">The Mind obtains its impressions of objects of the outside world by means</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">of the brain and sense organs. The sensory organs are the instruments of the</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">Mind, as is also the brain and the entire nervous system. By means of the</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">nerves, and the brain, the Mind makes use of the sensory organs in order</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="366" height="14" font="1">that it may obtain information regarding external objects.</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">The senses are usually said to consist of five different forms, _viz._, sight,</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="203" height="14" font="1">hearing, smell, touch, and taste.</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="393" height="14" font="1">The Yogis teach that there are higher senses, undeveloped, or</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">comparatively so, in the majority of the race, but toward the unfoldment of</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">which the race is tending. But we shall not touch upon these latent senses in</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">this lesson, as they belong to another phase of the subject. In addition to the</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">five senses above enumerated, some physiologists and psychologists have</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">held that there were several others in evidence. For instance, the sense by</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">which the inner organs revealed their presence and condition, The muscular</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">system reports to the mind through some sense that is not that of &quot;touch,&quot;</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">although closely allied to it. And the feelings of hunger, thirst, etc., seem to</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="248" height="14" font="1">come to us through an unnamed sense.</text>

<text top="63" left="72" width="436" height="14" font="1">Bernstein has distinguished between the five senses and the one just</text>
<text top="82" left="72" width="431" height="14" font="1">referred to as follows: &quot;The characteristic distinction between these</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">common sensations and the sensations of the senses is that by the latter we</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">gain knowledge of the occurrences and objects which belong to the external</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">world (and which sensations we refer to external objects), whilst by the</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="318" height="14" font="1">former we only feel conditions of our own body.&quot;</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">A sensation is the internal, mental conception, resulting from an external</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="448" height="14" font="1">object or fact exciting the sense organs and nerves, and the brain, thus</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">making the mind &quot;aware&quot; of the external object or fact. As Bain has said, it</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">is the &quot;mental impression, feeling, or conscious state, resulting from the</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">action of external things on some part of the body, called on that account,</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="67" height="14" font="1">sensitive.&quot;</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="447" height="14" font="1">Each channel of sense impressions has an organ, or organs, peculiarly</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="424" height="14" font="1">adapted for the excitation of its substance by the particular kind of</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="420" height="14" font="1">vibrations through which it receives impressions. The eye is most</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="417" height="14" font="1">cunningly and carefully designed to receive the light−waves; and</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="430" height="14" font="1">sound−waves produce no effect upon it. And, likewise, the delicate</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">mechanism of the ear responds only to sound−waves; light−waves failing</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="443" height="14" font="1">to register upon it. Each set of sensations is entirely different, and the</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">organs and nerves designed to register each particular set are peculiarly</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">adapted to their own special work. The organs of sense, including their</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">special nervous systems, may be compared to a delicate instrument that the</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">mind has fashioned for itself, that it may investigate, examine and obtain</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="199" height="14" font="1">reports from the outside world.</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">We have become so accustomed to the workings of the senses that we take</text>

<text top="274" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">together, and so to acquire a certain bulk and to occupy a certain time, for if</text>

<text top="485" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">impressions, coming to us from without, are indeed &quot;material&quot; upon which</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="448" height="14" font="1">the mind works in order to manufacture the product called &quot;Thought.&quot;</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">This material we obtain through the channels of the senses, and then store</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="446" height="14" font="1">in that wonderful storehouse, the Memory, from whence we bring out</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">material from time to time, which we proceed to weave into the fabric of</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">Thought. The skill of the worker depends upon his training, and his ability</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="448" height="14" font="1">to select and combine the proper materials. And the acquiring of good</text>

<text top="293" left="72" width="64" height="14" font="1">produced.</text>

<text top="351" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">to proceed to develop our organs of sense, and their attendant mechanism,</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="435" height="14" font="1">as by doing so we increase our capacity for thought and knowledge.</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">Before passing to the exercises, however, it may be well to give a hasty</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="378" height="14" font="1">passing glance at the several senses, and their peculiarities.</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">The sense of Touch is the simplest and primal sense. Long before the lower</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">forms of life had developed the higher senses, they had evidenced the sense</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">of Touch or Feeling. Without this sense they would have been unable to</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">have found their food, or to receive and respond to outside impressions. In</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">the early forms of life it was exercised equally by all parts of the body,</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">although in the higher forms this sense has become somewhat localized, as</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">certain parts of the body are far more sensitive than are others. The skin is</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">the seat of the sense of Touch, and its nerves are distributed over the entire</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">area of the skin. The hand, and particularly the fingers, and their tips, are</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="214" height="14" font="1">the principal organs of this sense.</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">The acuteness of Touch varies materially in different parts of the body.</text>

<text top="82" left="72" width="437" height="14" font="1">as a standard, it was found that the palmar surface of the third finger</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">registered 2 lines; the surface of the lips 4 lines, and the skin of the back,</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">and on the middle of the arm or thigh, as high as 60 lines The degree of</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="444" height="14" font="1">sensitiveness to Touch varies greatly with different individuals, some</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">having a very fine sense of touch in their fingers, while others manifested a</text>

<text top="217" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">In the same way, there is a great difference in the response of the fingers to</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">weight−−a great difference in the ability to distinguish the difference of the</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="442" height="14" font="1">weight of objects. It has been found that some people can distinguish</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="437" height="14" font="1">differences in weight down to very small fractions of an ounce. Fine</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="439" height="14" font="1">distinctions in the differences in temperature have also been noticed.</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">The sense of touch, and its development has meant much for Man. It is the</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">one sense in which Man surpasses the animals in the matter of degree and</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">acuteness. The animal may have a keener smell, taste, hearing and sight,</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">but its sense of Touch is far beneath that of Man. Anaxagoras is quoted as</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">saying that &quot;if the animals had hands and fingers, they would be like men.&quot;</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="423" height="14" font="1">In developing the sense of Touch, the student must remember that</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="456" height="14" font="1">Attention is the key to success. The greater the amount of Attention the</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">greater the degree of development possible in the case of any sense. When</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">the Attention is concentrated upon any particular sense, the latter becomes</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">quickened and more acute, and repeated exercise, under the stimulus of</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">Attention, will work wonders in the case of any particular sense. And on</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">the other hand, the sense of touch may be almost, or completely inhibited,</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">by firmly fixing the Attention upon something else. As an extreme proof of</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">this latter fact, the student is asked to remember the fact that men have been</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">known to suffer excruciating torture, apparently without feeling, owing to</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">the mind being intently riveted upon some idea or thought. As Wyld has</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">said, &quot;The martyr borne above sensuous impressions, is not only able to</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">endure tortures, but is able to endure and quench them. The pinching and</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">cutting of the flesh only added energy to the death song of the American</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">Indian, and even the slave under the lash is sustained by the indignant sense</text>

<text top="82" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">Touch, the development is marvelous. The engraver passes his hand over</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="448" height="14" font="1">the plate, and is able to distinguish the slightest imperfection. And the</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">handler of cloth and fabrics is able to distinguish the finest differences,</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">simply by the sense of touch. Wool sorters also exercise a wonderfully high</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">degree of fineness of touch. And the blind are able to make up for the loss</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">of sight by their greatly increased sense of Touch, cases being recorded</text>

<text top="274" left="72" width="445" height="14" font="1">authorities have considered Taste as a very highly developed sense of</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="431" height="14" font="1">Touch in certain surfaces of the body, the tongue notably. It will be</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">remembered that the tongue has the finest sense of Touch, and it also has</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">the sense of Taste developed to perfection. In Taste and Touch the object</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">must be brought in direct contact with the organ of sense, which is not the</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="452" height="14" font="1">case in Smell, Hearing, or Sight. And, be it remembered, that the latter</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">senses have special nerves, while Taste is compelled to fall back upon the</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">ordinary nerves of Touch. It is true that Taste is confined to a very small</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="438" height="14" font="1">part of the surface of the body, while Touch is general. But this only</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">indicates a special development of the special area. The sense of Taste also</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">depends to a great extent upon the presence of fluids, and only substances</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">that are soluble make their presence known through the organs and sense of</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="39" height="14" font="1">Taste.</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">Physiologists report that the sense of Taste in some persons is so acute that</text>

<text top="63" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">The sense of Smell operates by reason of the tiny particles or the object</text>
<text top="82" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">being carried to the mucous membrane of the interior of the nose, by means</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">of the air. The membrane, being moist, seizes and holds these particles for a</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">moment, and the fine nervous organism reports differences and qualities</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="366" height="14" font="1">and the Mind is thus informed of the nature of the object.</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="444" height="14" font="1">The sense of Smell is very highly developed among animals, who are</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">compelled to rely upon it to a considerable extent. And many occupations</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="428" height="14" font="1">among men require the development of this sense, for instance, the</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">tobacconist, the wine dealer, the perfumers, the chemist, etc. It is related</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="448" height="14" font="1">that in the cases of certain blind people, it has been observed that they</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="262" height="14" font="1">could distinguish persons in this manner.</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="448" height="14" font="1">The sense of Hearing is a more complex one than in the case of Taste,</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="436" height="14" font="1">Touch and Smell. In the latter three the objects to be sensed must be</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">brought in close contact with the sense−organs, while in Hearing the object</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">may be far removed, the impressions being carried by the vibrations of the</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">air, which are caught up and reported upon by the nervous organism of the</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">sense of Hearing. The internal mechanism of the ear is most wonderfully</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">intricate and complex, and excites to wonder the person examining it. It</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">cannot be described here for want of space, but the student is advised to</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="438" height="14" font="1">inquire into it if he has access to any library containing books on the</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">subject. It is a wonderful illustration of the work of the mind in building up</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="422" height="14" font="1">for itself instruments with which to work−−to acquire knowledge.</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">The ear records vibrations in the air from 20 or 32 per second, the rate of</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="441" height="14" font="1">the lowest audible note, to those of 38,000 per second, the rate of the</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">highest audible note. There is a great difference in individuals in regard to</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">the fineness of the sense of Hearing. But all may develop this sense by the</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">application of Attention. The animals and savages have wonderfully acute</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="413" height="14" font="1">senses of Hearing developed only along the lines of distinctness,</text>

<text top="82" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">the mind than any of its associate senses. It is the sense of Touch magnified</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">many times. As Wilson says of it, &quot;Our sight may be considered as a more</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="445" height="14" font="1">delicate and diffusive kind of touch that spreads itself over an infinite</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">number of bodies; comprehends the largest figures, and brings into our</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="342" height="14" font="1">reach some of the most remote parts of the universe.&quot;</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="445" height="14" font="1">The sense of Sight receives its impressions from the outside world by</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">means of waves that travel from body to body−−from sun to earth, and</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">from lamp to eye. These waves of light arise from vibrations in substance,</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">of an almost incredible degree of rapidity. The lowest light vibration is</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="420" height="14" font="1">about 450,000,000,000,000 per second, while the highest is about</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="423" height="14" font="1">750,000,000,000,000 per second. These figures deal only with the</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">vibrations recognizable by the eye as light. Above and below these figures</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">of the scale are countless other degrees invisible to the eye, although some</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">of them may be recorded by instruments. The different sensations of color,</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">depend upon the rate of the vibrations, red being the limit of the lowest, and</text>

<text top="485" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">parts of an object, a degree of knowledge regarding it is obtained that one</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">may not acquire without the said exercise of the faculty. We have spoken of</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">this under the subject of Attention, in a previous lesson, to which lesson we</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">again refer the student. The fixing of the eye upon an object has the power</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">of concentrating the thoughts and preventing them from wandering. The</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="448" height="14" font="1">eye has other properties and qualities that will be dwelt upon in future</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="423" height="14" font="1">lessons. It has other uses than seeing. The influence of the eye is a</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="353" height="14" font="1">marvelous thing, and may be cultivated and developed.</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">We trust that what we have said will bring the student to a realization of the</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">importance of developing the powers of Perception. The senses have been</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">developed by the mind during a long period of evolution and effort that</text>

<text top="370" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">urgings, but also in the matter of developing them to a high degree. The</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="417" height="14" font="1">development of the physical senses, also has much to do with the</text>

<text top="524" left="72" width="416" height="14" font="1">In our future lessons we shall give the student many illustrations,</text>

<text top="63" left="72" width="259" height="14" font="1">GENERAL RULES OF PERCEPTION.</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">The first thing to remember in acquiring the art of Perception is that one</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">should not attempt to perceive the whole of a complex thing or object at the</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">same time, or at once. One should consider the object in detail, and then, by</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">grouping the details, he will find that he has considered the whole. Let us</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">take the face of a person as a familiar object. If one tries to perceive a face</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">as a whole, he will find that he will meet with a certain degree of failure,</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="444" height="14" font="1">the impression being indistinct and cloudy, it following, also, that the</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="419" height="14" font="1">memory of that face will correspond with the original perception.</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">But let the observer consider the face in detail, first the eyes, then the nose,</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">then the mouth, then the chin, then the hair, then the outline of the face, the</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">complexion, etc., and he will find that he will have acquired a clear and</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="329" height="14" font="1">distinct impression or perception of the whole face.</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">The same rule may be applied to any subject or object. Let us take another</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">familiar illustration. You wish to observe a building. If you simply get a</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">general perception of the building as a whole, you will be able to remember</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">very little about it, except its general outlines, shape, size, color, etc. And a</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">description will prove to be very disappointing. But if you have noted, _in</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">detail_, the material used, the shape of the doors, chimney, roof, porches,</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="402" height="14" font="1">decorations, trimmings, ornamentation, size and number of the</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">window−panes etc., etc., the shape and angles of the roof, etc., you will</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="444" height="14" font="1">have an<i> intelligent</i> idea of the building, in the place of a mere general</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">outline or impression of such as might be acquired by an animal in passing.</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="441" height="14" font="1">We will conclude this lesson with an anecdote of the methods of that</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">famous naturalist Agassiz, in his training of his pupils. His pupils became</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">renowned for their close powers of observation and perception, and their</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">consequent ability to &quot;think&quot; about the things they had seen. Many of them</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">rose to eminent positions, and claimed that this was largely by reason of</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="136" height="14" font="1">their careful training.</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="450" height="14" font="1">The tale runs that a new student presented himself to Agassiz one day,</text>
<text top="735" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">asking to be set to work. The naturalist took a fish from a jar in which it</text>

<text top="63" left="72" width="437" height="14" font="1">had been preserved, and laying it before the young student bade him</text>
<text top="82" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">observe it carefully, and be ready to report upon what he had noticed about</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">the fish. The student was then left alone with the fish. There was nothing</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">especially interesting about that fish−−it was like many other fishes that he</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">had seen before. He noticed that it had fins and scales, and a mouth and</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">eyes, yes, and a tail. In a half hour he felt certain that he had observed all</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">about that fish that there was to be perceived. But the naturalist remained</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="38" height="14" font="1">away.</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">The time rolled on, and the youth, having nothing else to do, began to grow</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">restless and weary. He started out to hunt up the teacher, but he failed to</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="438" height="14" font="1">find him, and so had to return and gaze again at that wearisome fish.</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="487" height="14" font="1">Several hours had passed, and he knew but little more about the fish than he</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="132" height="14" font="1">did in the first place.</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">He went out to lunch and when he returned it was still a case of watching</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">the fish. He felt disgusted and discouraged, and wished he had never come</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">to Agassiz, whom, it seemed, was a stupid old man after all,−−one away</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">behind the times. Then, in order to kill time, he began to count the scales.</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">This completed he counted the spines of the fins. Then he began to draw a</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">picture of the fish. In drawing the picture he noticed that the fish had no</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="456" height="14" font="1">eyelids. He thus made the discovery that as his teacher had expressed it</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">often, in lectures, &quot;a pencil is the best of eyes.&quot; Shortly after the teacher</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">returned, and after ascertaining what the youth had observed, he left rather</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">disappointed, telling the boy to keep on looking and maybe he would see</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="71" height="14" font="1">something.</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="439" height="14" font="1">This put the boy on his mettle, and he began to work with his pencil,</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="451" height="14" font="1">putting down little details that had escaped him before, but which now</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="450" height="14" font="1">seemed very plain to him. He began to catch the secret of observation.</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">Little by little he brought to light new objects of interest about the fish. But</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">this did not suffice his teacher, who kept him at work on the same fish for</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">three whole days. At the end of that time the student really knew something</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">about the fish, and, better than all, had acquired the &quot;knack&quot; and habit of</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="282" height="14" font="1">careful observation and perception in detail.</text>

<text top="178" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">Apart from the value to the student of the particular information obtained,</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">was the quickening of the perceptive faculties that enabled him to observe</text>

<text top="236" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">important information from that which was observed. The Mind is hungry</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">for knowledge, and it has by years of weary evolution and effort built up a</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="452" height="14" font="1">series of sense systems in order to yield it that knowledge and it is still</text>

<text top="485" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">Consciousness&quot;−−a most interesting subject. Many of us have been in the</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">habit of identifying &quot;consciousness&quot; with mind, but as we proceed with this</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">series of lessons we will see that that which is called &quot;consciousness&quot; is but</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">a small portion of the mind of the individual, and even that small part is</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="451" height="14" font="1">constantly changing its states, and unfolding new states undreamed of.</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">&quot;Consciousness&quot; is a word we use very often in considering the science of</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">the Mind. Let us see what it means. Webster defines it as one's &quot;knowledge</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">of sensations and mental operations, or of what passes in one's own mind.&quot;</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">Halleck defines it as &quot;that undefinable characteristic of mental states which</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">causes one to be aware of them.&quot; But, as Halleck states, &quot;Consciousness is</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">incapable of definition. To define anything we are obliged to describe it in</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="430" height="14" font="1">terms of something else. And there is nothing else in the world like</text>
<text top="735" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">consciousness, hence we can define it only in terms of itself, and that is</text>

<text top="82" left="72" width="417" height="14" font="1">Consciousness is one of the greatest mysteries that confronts us.&quot;</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">Before we can understand what Consciousness really is, we must know just</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">what &quot;Mind&quot; really is−−and that knowledge is lacking, notwithstanding the</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="441" height="14" font="1">many injenious theories evolved in order to explain the mystery. The</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="421" height="14" font="1">metaphysicians do not throw much light on the subject, and as for</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">materialistic science, listen to what Huxley says: &quot;How it comes about that</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="452" height="14" font="1">anything so remarkable as a state of consciousness comes about by the</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">result of irritating nervous tissue, is just as unaccountable as the appearance</text>

<text top="293" left="72" width="446" height="14" font="1">To many persons the words &quot;consciousness&quot; and &quot;mental process,&quot; or</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">&quot;thought&quot; are regarded as synonymous. And, in fact, psychologists so held</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">until quite recently. But now it is generally accepted as a fact that mental</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="434" height="14" font="1">processes are not limited to the field of consciousness, and it is now</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="437" height="14" font="1">generally taught that the field of sub−consciousness (that is, &quot;under&quot;</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">conscious) mentation, is of a much greater extent than that of conscious</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="68" height="14" font="1">mentation.</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">Not only is it true that the mind can hold in consciousness but one fact at</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">any one instant, and that, consequently, only a very small fraction of our</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">knowledge can be in consciousness at any one moment, but it is also true</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">that the consciousness plays but a very small part in the totality of mental</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">processes, or mentation. The mind is not conscious of the greater portion of</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">its own activities−−Maudsley says that only ten per cent comes into the</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">field of consciousness. Taine has stated it in these words: &quot;Of the world</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="441" height="14" font="1">which makes up our being, we only perceive the highest points−−the</text>

<text top="639" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">But it is not our intention to speak of this great subconscious region of the</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="436" height="14" font="1">mind at this point, for we shall have much to do with it later on. It is</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">mentioned here in order to show that the enlargement or development of</text>

<text top="217" left="72" width="423" height="14" font="1">circumstances. He is aware of the discomfort, just as would be the</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">man−−and he would run home if he could just as would the man. But he is</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">not able to pity himself, nor to think about his personality as would the</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">man, nor does he wonder whether such a life is worth living, after all. He</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="444" height="14" font="1">&quot;knows,&quot; but is not able to think of himself as knowing−−he does not</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="451" height="14" font="1">&quot;know that he knows,&quot; as we do. He experiences the physical pain and</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">discomfort, but is spared the mental discomfort and concern arising from</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="294" height="14" font="1">the physical, which man so often experiences.</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">The animal cannot shift its consciousness from the sensations of the outer</text>

<text top="428" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">difference may be clumsily illustrated by the example of a man feeling,</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">seeing or hearing something that gives him a pleasurable sensation, or the</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="411" height="14" font="1">reverse. He is conscious of the feeling or sensation, and that it is</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">pleasurable or otherwise. That is Physical Consciousness, and the animal</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">may share it with him. But it stops right there with the animal. But the man</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">may begin to wonder<i> why</i> the sensation is pleasurable and to associate it</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="456" height="14" font="1">with other things and persons; or speculate<i> why</i> he dislikes it, what will</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">follow, and so on−−that is Mental Consciousness, because he recognizes an</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">inward self, and is turning his attention<i> inward</i>. He may see another man</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">and experience a feeling or sensation of attraction or aversion−−like or</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">dislike. This is Physical Consciousness, and an animal also may experience</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">the sensation. But the man goes further than the animal, and wonders just</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">what there is about the man he likes or detests, and may compare himself to</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">the man and wonder whether the latter feels as he does, and so on−−this is</text>

<text top="101" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">inward after its outward journey. The animal &quot;knows&quot;−−the man not only</text>

<text top="140" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">&quot;knowing&quot; and speculate about it. We call this higher consciousness Mental</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="415" height="14" font="1">Consciousness. The operation of Physical Consciousness we call</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="420" height="14" font="1">Instinct−−the operation of Mental Consciousness we call Reason.</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="442" height="14" font="1">The Man who has Mental Consciousness not only &quot;feels&quot; or &quot;senses&quot;</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">things, but he has words or mental concepts of these feelings and sensations</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">and may think of himself as experiencing them, separating himself, the</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">sensation or feeling, and the thing felt or sensed. The man is able to think:</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">&quot;I feel; I hear; I see; I smell; I taste; I desire; I do,&quot; etc., etc. The very words</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">indicate Mental Consciousness recognizing mental states and giving them</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="448" height="14" font="1">names, and also recognizing something called &quot;I&quot; that experiences the</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="487" height="14" font="1">sensations. This latter fact has caused psychologists to speak of this stage as</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">&quot;Self−consciousness,&quot; but we reserve this idea of the &quot;I&quot; consciousness for</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="93" height="14" font="1">a higher stage.</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">The animal experiences something that gives it the impressions or feeling</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="487" height="14" font="1">that we call &quot;pain,&quot; &quot;hurt,&quot; &quot;pleasant,&quot; &quot;sweet,&quot; &quot;bitter,&quot; etc., all being forms</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">of sensation, but it is unable to think of them in words. The pain seems to</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">be a part of itself, although possibly associated with some person or thing</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">that caused it. The study of the unfoldment of consciousness in a young</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">baby will give one a far better idea of the grades and distinctions than can</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="244" height="14" font="1">be obtained from reading mere words.</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">Mental Consciousness is a growth. As Halleck says, &quot;Many persons never</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">have more than a misty idea of such a mental attitude. They always take</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="435" height="14" font="1">themselves for granted, and never turn the gaze inward.&quot; It has been</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">doubted whether the savages have developed Self−consciousness, and even</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="438" height="14" font="1">many men of our own race seem to be but little above the animals in</text>

<text top="697" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">even slightly. To them the &quot;I&quot; seems to be a purely physical thing−−a body</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">having desires and feeling but little more. They are able to feel an act, but</text>
<text top="735" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">scarcely more. They are not able to set aside any physical &quot;not−−I,&quot; being</text>

<text top="82" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">and the Body are one with them, and they seem incapable of distinguishing</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="93" height="14" font="1">between them.</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">Then comes another stage in which mental−consciousness proper sets in.</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="433" height="14" font="1">The man begins to realize that he has &quot;a mind.&quot; He is able to &quot;know</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">himself&quot; as a mental being, and to turn the gaze inward a little. This period</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">of development may be noticed in young children. For a time they speak of</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">themselves as a third person, until finally they begin to say &quot;I.&quot; Then a little</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">later comes the ability to know their own mental states as such−−they know</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">that they have a mind, and are able to distinguish between it and the body.</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">It is related that some children experience a feeling of terror when they pass</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">into this stage. They exhibit signs of bashfulness and what is commonly</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">termed &quot;self−consciousness&quot; in that sense. Some tell us in after years that</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">when they became aware of themselves as an entity they were overcome</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">with alarm, as if by a sense of loneliness and apartness from the Universe.</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">Young people often feel this way for several years. There seems to be a</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">distinct feeling that the Universe is antagonistic to and set apart from them.</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">And, although this feeling of separateness and apartness grows less acute as</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">the man grows older, yet it is always present to a greater or less degree until</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">a still higher stage−−the Ego−consciousness is reached, when it disappears</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">as we shall see. And this mental−conscious stage is a hard one for many.</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="447" height="14" font="1">They are entangled in a mass of mental states which the man thinks is</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">&quot;himself,&quot; and the struggle between the real &quot;I&quot; and its confining sheaths is</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">painful. And it becomes still more painful as the end is neared, for as man</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">advances in mental−consciousness and knowledge he feels more keenly</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">and suffers accordingly. Man eats the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge and</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">begins to suffer, and is driven out of the Garden of Eden of the child and</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">primitive races, who live like the birds of the air and concern themselves</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">not about mental states and problems. But there is deliverance ahead in the</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">shape of a higher consciousness, although but few realize it and still fewer</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="421" height="14" font="1">have gained it. Perhaps this lesson may point out the way for you.</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="487" height="14" font="1">With the birth of mental−consciousness comes the knowledge that there is a</text>
<text top="735" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">mind in others. Man is able to speculate and reason about the mental states</text>

<text top="121" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">greatest importance to that part of his nature. Some men worship Intellect</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">as a God, ignoring its limitations which other thinkers have pointed out.</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="438" height="14" font="1">Such people are apt to reason that because the human intellect (in its</text>

<text top="197" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">possibly be, that the matter is forever settled. They ignore the fact that it is</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">possible that Man's Intellect, in its present state of unfoldment, may be able</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">to take cognizance of only a very small part of the Universal Fact, and that</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">there may be regions upon regions of Reality and Fact of which he cannot</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">even dream, so far are they removed from his experience. The unfoldment</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">of a new sense would open out a new world and might bring to light facts</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="456" height="14" font="1">that would completely revolutionize our entire world of conceptions by</text>

<text top="447" left="72" width="444" height="14" font="1">Facts, bringing to light new treasures every day. This stage of Mental</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">Consciousness is bringing to Man knowledge of himself−−knowledge of</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">the Universe−−that is well worth the price he pays for it. For Man<i> does</i> pay</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">a price for entrance into this stage−−and he pays an increasing price as he</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">advances in its territory, for the higher he advances the more keenly he</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">feels and suffers, as well as enjoys. Capacity for pain is the price Man pays</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">for Attainment, up to a certain stage. His pain passes from the Physical to</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">the Mental consciousness, and he becomes aware of problems that he never</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="443" height="14" font="1">dreamt existed, and the lack of an intelligent answer produces mental</text>

<text top="140" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">There are two planes of Consciousness, of which we feel it proper to speak,</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">for we have obtained more or less information regarding them. There are</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">still higher planes, but they belong to higher phases of life than are dealt</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="64" height="14" font="1">with here.</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="396" height="14" font="1">The first of these planes or states of Consciousness, above the</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">&quot;Self−Consciousness&quot; of the psychologists (which we have called &quot;Mental</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="444" height="14" font="1">Consciousness&quot;) may be called &quot;Ego−consciousness,&quot; for it brings an</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">&quot;awareness&quot; of the Reality of the Ego. This &quot;awareness&quot; is far above the</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">Self−consciousness of the man who is able to distinguish &quot;I&quot; from &quot;You,&quot;</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">and to give it a name. And far above the consciousness that enables a man,</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">as he rises in the scale, to distinguish the &quot;I&quot; from faculty after faculty of</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">the mind, which he is able to recognize as &quot;not−−I,&quot; until he finds left a</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">mental something that he cannot set aside, which he calls &quot;I&quot;−−although</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="487" height="14" font="1">this stage alone is very much higher than that of the average of the race, and</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">is a high degree of Attainment itself. It is akin to this last stage, and yet still</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">fuller and more complete. In the dawning of Ego Consciousness the &quot;I&quot;</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">recognizes itself still more clearly and, more than this, is fully imbued with</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">a sense and &quot;awareness&quot; of its own _Reality_, unknown to it before. This</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">awareness is not a mere matter of reasoning−−it is a &quot;consciousness,&quot; just</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="430" height="14" font="1">as is Physical Consciousness and Mental Consciousness something</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">different from an &quot;intellectual conviction.&quot; It is a Knowing, not a Thinking</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="443" height="14" font="1">or Believing. The &quot;I&quot;<i> knows</i> that it is Real−−that it has its roots in the</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">Supreme Reality underlying all the Universe, and partakes of its Essence. It</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="428" height="14" font="1">does not know what this Reality is, but it knows that it is Real, and</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">something different from anything in the world of name, form, number,</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">time, space, cause and effect−−something Transcendental and surpassing</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="429" height="14" font="1">all human experience. And knowing this, it knows that it cannot be</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">destroyed or hurt; cannot die, but is immortal; and that there is Something</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">which is the very essence of Good behind of, underneath and even<i> in</i> itself.</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">And in this certainty and consciousness is there Peace, Understanding and</text>

<text top="351" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">he has ceased to worry about them−−they now disturb him not. He may use</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">his intellect upon them as before, but never with the feeling that in their</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">intellectual solution rests his happiness or peace of mind. He knows that he</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">stands on solid rock, and though the storms of the world of matter and force</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">may beat upon him, he will not be hurt. This and other things he knows. He</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="439" height="14" font="1">cannot prove these things to others, for they are not demonstrable by</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">argument−−he himself did not get them in that way. And so he says but</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">little about it−−but lives his life as if he knew them not, so far as outward</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">appearances go. But inwardly he is a changed man−−his life is different</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">from that of his brothers, for while their souls are wrapped in slumber or</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">are tossing in troubled dreams, his Soul has awakened and is gazing upon</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="447" height="14" font="1">the world with bright and fearless eyes. There are, of course, different</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">stages or degrees of this Consciousness, just as there are in the lower planes</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">of consciousness. Some have it to a slight degree, while others have it fully.</text>

<text top="63" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">There is a stage still higher than this last mentioned but it has come to but</text>
<text top="82" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">very few of the race. Reports of it come from all times, races, countries. It</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">has been called &quot;Cosmic Consciousness,&quot; and is described as an awareness</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">of the Oneness of Life−−that is, a consciousness that the Universe is filled</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">with One Life−−an actual perception and &quot;awareness&quot; that the Universe is</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="448" height="14" font="1">full of Life, Motion and Mind, and that there is no such thing as Blind</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">Force, or Dead Matter, but that All is alive, vibrating and intelligent. That</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">is, of course, that the _Real Universe_, which is the Essence or background</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">of the Universe of Matter, Energy and Mind, is as they describe. In fact, the</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">description of those who have had glimpses of this state would indicate that</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">they see the Universe as All Mind−−that All is Mind at the last. This form</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">of consciousness has been experienced by men here and there−−only a</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">few−−in moments of &quot;Illumination,&quot; the period lasting but a very short</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">space of time, then fading away, leaving but a memory. In the moment of</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="410" height="14" font="1">the &quot;Illumination&quot; there came to those experiencing it a sense of</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="487" height="14" font="1">&quot;intouch−ness&quot; with Universal Knowledge and Life, impossible to describe,</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="292" height="14" font="1">accompanied by a Joy beyond understanding.</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">Regarding this last, &quot;Cosmic Consciousness,&quot; we would state that it means</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="456" height="14" font="1">more than an intellectual conviction, belief or realization of the facts as</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">stated, for an actual<i> vision</i> and<i> consciousness</i> of these things came in the</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">moment of Illumination. Some others report that they have a deep abiding</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">sense of the reality of the facts described by the report of the Illumined, but</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">have not experienced the &quot;vision&quot; or ecstasy referred to. These last people</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">seem to have with them always the same mental state as that possessed by</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">those who had the &quot;vision&quot; and passed out of it, carrying with them the</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">remembrance and feeling, but not the actual consciousness attained at the</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="440" height="14" font="1">moment. They agree upon the essential particulars of the reports. Dr.</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">Maurice Bucke, now passed out of this plane of life, wrote a book entitled</text>

<text top="639" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">including his own, Walt Whitman's and others, and in which he holds that</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">this stage of consciousness is before the race and will gradually come to it</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">in the future. He holds that the manifestation of it which has come to some</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">few of the race, as above stated, is but the first beams of the sun which are</text>

<text top="82" left="72" width="448" height="14" font="1">personages of the past, who have left records that in moments of great</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">spiritual exaltation they became conscious of &quot;being in the presence of the</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">Absolute,&quot; or perhaps within the radius of &quot;the light of Its countenance.&quot;</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">We have great respect for these reports, and have every reason for believing</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">many of them authentic, notwithstanding the conflicting reports that have</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">been handed down to us by those experiencing them. These reports are</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="438" height="14" font="1">conflicting because of the fact that the minds of those who had these</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">glimpses of consciousness were not prepared or trained to fully understand</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="436" height="14" font="1">the nature of the phenomena. They found themselves in the spiritual</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="447" height="14" font="1">presence of Something of awful grandeur and spiritual rank, and were</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">completely dazed and bewildered at the sight. They did not understand the</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="447" height="14" font="1">nature of the Absolute, and when they had sufficiently recovered they</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">reported that they had been in the &quot;presence of God&quot;−−the word &quot;God&quot;</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">meaning their particular conception of Deity−−that is, the one appearing as</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">Deity in their own particular religious creed or school. They saw nothing to</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">cause them to identify this Something with their particular conception of</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">Deity, except that they thought that &quot;it<i> must</i> be God,&quot; and knowing no other</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">God except their own particular conception, they naturally identifying the</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="449" height="14" font="1">Something with &quot;God&quot; as they conceived Him to be. And their reports</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="207" height="14" font="1">naturally were along these lines.</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">Thus the reports of all religions are filled with accounts of the so−called</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">miraculous occurrences. The Catholic saint reports that he &quot;saw of light of</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">God's countenance,&quot; and the non−Catholic reports likewise regarding God</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">as he knows him. The Mohammedan reports that he caught a glimpse of the</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">face of Allah, and the Buddhist tells us that he saw Buddha under the tree.</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="456" height="14" font="1">The Brahman has seen the face of Brahma, and the various Hindu sects</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">have men who give similar reports regarding their own particular deities.</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">The Persians have given similar reports, and even the ancient Egyptians</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">have left records of similar occurrences. These conflicting reports have led</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">to the belief, on the part of those who did not understand the nature of the</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">phenomena, that these things were &quot;all imagination&quot; and fancy, if indeed</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">not rank falsehood and imposture. But the Yogis know better than this.</text>

<text top="255" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">advanced Beings. So the Yogi accepts these reports of the various mystics,</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">saints and inspired ones, and accounts for them all by laws perfectly natural</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">to the students of the Yogi Philosophy, but which appear as supernatural to</text>

<text top="389" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">subject before us. But we wish to be understood as saying that there are</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="452" height="14" font="1">certain centers in the mental being of Man from which may come light</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">regarding the existence of the Absolute and higher order of Beings. In fact,</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">from these centers come to man that part of his mental &quot;feelings&quot; that he</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="433" height="14" font="1">calls &quot;the religious instinct or intuition.&quot; Man does not arrive at that</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="426" height="14" font="1">underlying consciousness of &quot;Something Beyond&quot; by means of his</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">Intellect−−it is the glimmer of light coming from the higher centers of the</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="445" height="14" font="1">Self. He notices these gleams of light, but not understanding them, he</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">proceeds to erect elaborate theological and creedal structures to account for</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">them, the work of the Intellect, however, always lacking that &quot;feeling&quot; that</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">the intuition itself possesses. True religion, no matter under what name it</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">may masquerade, comes from the &quot;heart&quot; and is not comforted or satisfied</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="442" height="14" font="1">with these Intellectual explanations, and hence comes that unrest and</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">craving for satisfaction which comes to Man when the light begins to break</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="54" height="14" font="1">through.</text>

<text top="372" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">The Self of each of us has a vehicle of expression which we call the Mind,</text>
<text top="391" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">but which vehicle is much larger and far more complex than we are apt to</text>
<text top="411" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">realize. As a writer has said &quot;Our Self is greater than we know; it has peaks</text>
<text top="430" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">above, and lowlands below the plateau of our conscious experience.&quot; That</text>
<text top="449" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">which we know as the &quot;conscious mind&quot; is not the Soul. The Soul is not a</text>
<text top="468" left="72" width="452" height="14" font="1">part of that which we know in consciousness, but, on the contrary, that</text>
<text top="487" left="72" width="442" height="14" font="1">which we know in consciousness is but a small part of the Soul−−the</text>
<text top="507" left="72" width="268" height="14" font="1">conscious vehicle of a greater Self, or &quot;I.&quot;</text>
<text top="545" left="72" width="409" height="14" font="1">The Yogis have always taught that the mind has many planes of</text>
<text top="564" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">manifestation and action−−and that many of its planes operated above and</text>
<text top="583" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">below the plane of consciousness. Western science is beginning to realize</text>
<text top="603" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">this fact, and its theories regarding same may be found in any of the later</text>
<text top="622" left="72" width="487" height="14" font="1">works on psychology. But this is a matter of recent development in Western</text>
<text top="641" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">science. Until very recently the text books held that Consciousness and</text>
<text top="660" left="72" width="446" height="14" font="1">Mind were synonymous, and that the Mind was conscious of all of its</text>
<text top="679" left="72" width="240" height="14" font="1">activities, changes and modifications.</text>
<text top="718" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">Liebnitz was one of the first Western philosophers to advance the idea that</text>

<text top="121" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">At the present time it is generally conceded that at least ninety per cent of</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="447" height="14" font="1">our mental operations take place in the out−of−conscious realm. Prof.</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">Elmer Gates, the well known scientist, has said: &quot;At least ninety per cent of</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="417" height="14" font="1">our mental life is sub−conscious. If you will analyze your mental</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">operations you will find that conscious thinking is never a continuous line</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="448" height="14" font="1">of consciousness, but a series of conscious data with great intervals of</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">subconscious. We sit and try to solve a problem, and fail. We walk around,</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">try again, and fail. Suddenly an idea dawns that leads to the solution of the</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">problem. The subconscious processes were at work. We do not volitionally</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">create our own thinking. It takes place in us. We are more or less passive</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">recipients. We cannot change the nature of a thought, or of a truth, but we</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">can, as it were,<i> guide the ship by a moving of the helm</i>. Our mentation is</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="349" height="14" font="1">largely the result of the great Cosmic Whole upon us.&quot;</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">Sir William Hamilton says that the sphere of our consciousness is only a</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">small circle in the center of a far wider sphere of action and thought, of</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="276" height="14" font="1">which we are conscious through its effects.</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">Taine says: &quot;Outside of a little luminous circle, lies a large ring of twilight,</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">and beyond this an indefinite night; but the events of this twilight and this</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="339" height="14" font="1">night are as real as those within the luminous circle.&quot;</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">Sir Oliver Lodge, the eminent English scientist, speaking of the planes of</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="442" height="14" font="1">the mind, says: &quot;Imagine an iceberg glorying in its crisp solidity, and</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="440" height="14" font="1">sparkling pinnacles, resenting attention paid to its submerged self, or</text>

<text top="620" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">which in due course it will some day return. Or, reversing the metaphor, we</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">might liken our present state to that of the hulls of ships submerged in a</text>

<text top="274" left="72" width="375" height="14" font="1">And other Western writers have noted and spoken of these</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">out−of−conscious realms. Lewes has said: &quot;It is very certain that in every</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">conscious volition−−every act that is so characterized−−the larger part of it</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">is quite unconscious. It is equally certain that in every perception there are</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">unconscious processes of reproduction and inference. There is a middle</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="456" height="14" font="1">distance of sub−consciousness, and a background of unconsciousness.&quot;</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">Taine has told us that: &quot;Mental events imperceptible to consciousness are</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="451" height="14" font="1">far more numerous than the others, and of the world that makes up our</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="446" height="14" font="1">being we only perceive the highest points−−the lighted−up peaks of a</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="434" height="14" font="1">continent whose lower levels remain in the shade. Beneath ordinary</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">sensations are their components, that is to say, the elementary sensations,</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="422" height="14" font="1">which must be combined into groups to reach our consciousness.&quot;</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">Maudsley says: &quot;Examine closely and without bias the ordinary mental</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="436" height="14" font="1">operations of daily life, and you will find that consciousness has not</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">one−tenth part of the function therein which it is commonly assumed to</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">have. In every conscious state there are at work conscious, sub−conscious,</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="430" height="14" font="1">and infra−conscious energies, the last as indispensable as the first.&quot;</text>

<text top="101" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">the solution of a problem he had long vainly dealt with, flashed across his</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="415" height="14" font="1">mind, he trembled as if in the presence of another being who had</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">communicated a secret to him. All of us have tried to remember a name or</text>

<text top="178" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">minds, only to have the missing name or thought suddenly presented to our</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">conscious mind a few minutes, or hours, afterwards. Something in our mind</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">was at work hunting up the missing word, and when it found it it presented</text>

<text top="274" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">A writer has mentioned what he called &quot;unconscious rumination,&quot; which</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="435" height="14" font="1">happened to him when he read books presenting new points of view</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">essentially opposed to his previous opinions. After days, weeks, or months,</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="443" height="14" font="1">he found that to his great astonishment the old opinions were entirely</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">rearranged, and new ones lodged there. Many examples of this unconscious</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">mental digestion and assimilation are mentioned in the books on the subject</text>

<text top="428" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">It is related of Sir W. R. Hamilton that he discovered quarternions one day</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">while walking with his wife in the observatory at Dublin. He relates that he</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">suddenly felt &quot;the galvanic circle of thought&quot; close, and the sparks that fell</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">from it was the fundamental mathematical relations of his problem, which</text>

<text top="581" left="72" width="440" height="14" font="1">my mind. It has many times seemed to me that I was really a passive</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">instrument in the hands of a person not myself. In view of having to wait</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">for the results of these unconscious processes, I have proved the habit of</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">getting together material in advance, and then leaving the mass to digest</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">itself till I am ready to write about it. I delayed for a month the writing of</text>

<text top="447" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">it were, on our horizon, or beneath the threshold of consciousness. The fact</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">that former ideas suddenly return to consciousness is simply explained by</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="431" height="14" font="1">the fact that they have continued psychic existence: and attention is</text>

<text top="140" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">unconsciousness. Indeed all our most vivid feelings are thus mystically</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="443" height="14" font="1">derived. Suddenly a new irrelevant, unwilled, unlooked−for presence</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">intrudes itself into consciousness. Some inscrutable power causes it to rise</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="436" height="14" font="1">and enter the mental presence as a sensorial constituent. If this vivid</text>

<text top="466" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">very distinct from one another, and observation itself necessarily conducts</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="400" height="14" font="1">to unity in psychology. But the agent of this unity is outside of</text>

<text top="524" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">For instance, the majority of these writers hastily assumed that because</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="432" height="14" font="1">there<i> was</i> an out−of−conscious plane of mentation, therefore all the</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">workings of the mind might be grouped under the head of &quot;conscious&quot; and</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">&quot;sub−conscious,&quot; and that all the out−of−conscious phenomena might be</text>

<text top="658" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">(which they called &quot;subjective&quot; or &quot;sub−conscious&quot;), they placed the lowest</text>

<text top="63" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">This mistake was a natural one, and at first reading the Western world was</text>
<text top="82" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">taken by storm, and accepted the new ideas and theories as Truth. But when</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="416" height="14" font="1">reflection came, and analysis was applied there arose a feeling of</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">disappointment and dissatisfaction, and people began to feel that there was</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="409" height="14" font="1">something lacking. They intuitively recognized that their higher</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">inspirations and intuitions came from a different part of the mind than the</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">lower emotions, passions, and other sub−conscious feelings, and instincts.</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">A glance at the Oriental philosophies will give one the key to the problem</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="424" height="14" font="1">at once. The Oriental teachers have always held that the conscious</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">mentation was but a small fraction of the entire volume of thought, but they</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="432" height="14" font="1">have always taught that just as there was a field of mentation<i> below</i></text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">consciousness, so was there a field of mentation<i> above</i> consciousness as</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">much higher than Intellect as the other was lower than it. The mere mention</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">of this fact will prove a revelation to those who have not heard it before,</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">and who have become entangled with the several &quot;dual−mind&quot; theories of</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">the recent Western writers. The more one has read on this subject the more</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">he will appreciate the superiority of the Oriental theory over that of the</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">Western writers. It is like the chemical which at once clears the clouded</text>

<text top="505" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">clearly, and adding to what we have said on the subject in previous books.</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="424" height="14" font="1">And all this is leading us toward the point where we may give you</text>

<text top="581" left="72" width="446" height="14" font="1">guidance of these out−of−conscious faculties. By retraining the lower</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">planes of mentation to their proper work, and by stimulating the higher</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">ones, man may &quot;make himself over.&quot; mentally, and may acquire powers of</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="432" height="14" font="1">which he but dreams now. This is why we are leading you up to the</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="446" height="14" font="1">understanding of this subject, step by step. We advise you to acquaint</text>

<text top="315" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">In our last lesson we told you something about the operation of the mind</text>
<text top="334" left="72" width="445" height="14" font="1">outside of the field of consciousness. In this lesson we will attempt to</text>
<text top="353" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">classify these out−of−consciousness planes, by directing your attention to</text>
<text top="372" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">the several mental planes above and below the plane of consciousness. As</text>
<text top="391" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">we stated in the last lesson, over 90 per cent of our mental operations are</text>
<text top="411" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">conducted outside of the field of consciousness, so that the consideration of</text>
<text top="430" left="72" width="286" height="14" font="1">the planes is seen to be an important subject.</text>
<text top="468" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">Man is a Centre of Consciousness in the great One Life of the Universe.</text>
<text top="487" left="72" width="437" height="14" font="1">His soul has climbed a great many steps before it reached its present</text>
<text top="507" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">position and stage of unfoldment. And it will pass through many more steps</text>
<text top="526" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">until it is entirely free and delivered from the necessity of its swaddling</text>
<text top="545" left="72" width="49" height="14" font="1">clothes.</text>
<text top="583" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">In his mental being man contains traces of all that has gone before−−all the</text>
<text top="603" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">experiences of himself and the great race movement of which he is a part.</text>
<text top="622" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">And, likewise, his mind contains faculties and mental planes which have</text>
<text top="641" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">not as yet unfolded into consciousness, and of the existence of which he is</text>
<text top="660" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">but imperfectly aware. All of these mental possessions, however, are useful</text>
<text top="679" left="72" width="423" height="14" font="1">and valuable to him−−even the lowest. The lowest may be used to</text>
<text top="699" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">advantage, under proper mastery, and are only dangerous to the man who</text>
<text top="718" left="72" width="416" height="14" font="1">allows them to master him instead of serving him as they should,</text>

<text top="63" left="72" width="447" height="14" font="1">In this consideration of the several mental planes we shall not confine</text>
<text top="82" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">ourselves to the technical occult terms given to these several planes, but</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="403" height="14" font="1">will place them in general groups and describe the features and</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">characteristics of each, rather than branch off into long explanations of the</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">growth and reason of the several planes, which would take us far away</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="298" height="14" font="1">from the practical consideration of the subject.</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">Beginning at the lowest point of the scale we see that man has a body. The</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">body is composed of minute cells of protoplasm. These cells are built up of</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">countless molecules, atoms and particles of matter−−precisely the same</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="442" height="14" font="1">matter that composes the rocks, trees, air, etc., around him. The Yogi</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="416" height="14" font="1">philosophy tells us that even the atoms of matter have life and an</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">elementary manifestation of mind, which causes them to group together</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="395" height="14" font="1">according to the law of attraction, forming different elements,</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">combinations, etc. This law of attraction is a mental operation, and is the</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">first evidence of mental choice, action and response. Below this is Prana or</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">Force, which, strictly speaking, is also a manifestation of mind, although</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">for convenience we designate it as a separate manifestation of the Absolute.</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="456" height="14" font="1">And therefore we find that this law of attraction between the atoms and</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">particles of matter is a mental action, and that it belongs to man's mental</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">kingdom, because he has a body and this mental action is continually going</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">on in his body. So therefore this is the lowest mental plane to be considered</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">in the make−up of the man. This plane is, of course, far sunken beneath the</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">plane of consciousness, and is scarcely identified with the personality of the</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">man at all, but rather belongs to the life of the whole, manifest in the rock</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="138" height="14" font="1">as well as in the man.</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">But after these atoms have been grouped by the law of attraction and have</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="441" height="14" font="1">formed molecules of matter, they are taken possession of by a higher</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">mental activity and built up into cells by the mental action of the plant. The</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="428" height="14" font="1">life impulse of the plant begins by drawing to it certain particles of</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="448" height="14" font="1">inorganic matter−−chemical elements−−and then building them into a</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="437" height="14" font="1">single cell. Oh, mystery of the cell! The intellect of man is unable to</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">duplicate this wonderful process. The Mind Principle on the Vegetative</text>

<text top="82" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">abode in that cell−−using it as a basis of operations, it proceeds to duplicate</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="447" height="14" font="1">its previous performance, and so cell after cell is added, by the simple</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="438" height="14" font="1">reproductive process of division and subdivision−−the primitive and</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="430" height="14" font="1">elemental sex process−−until the mighty plant is built up. From the</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">humblest vegetable organism up to the greatest oak the process is the same.</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">And it does not stop there. The body of man is also built up in just this way,</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="432" height="14" font="1">and he has this vegetative mind also within him, below the plane of</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">consciousness, of course. To many this thought of a vegetative mind may</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">be somewhat startling. But let us remember that every part of our body has</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="447" height="14" font="1">been built up from the vegetable cell. The unborn child starts with the</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">coalition of two cells. These cells begin to build up the new body for the</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">occupancy of the child−−that is, the mind principle in the cells directs the</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">work, of course−−drawing upon the body of the mother for nourishment</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">and supplies. The nourishment in the mother's blood, which supplies the</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">material for the building up of the child's body, is obtained by the mother</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">eating and assimilating the vegetable cells of plants, directly or indirectly.</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">If she eats fruit, nuts, vegetables, etc., she obtains the nourishment of the</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">plant life directly−−if she eats meat she obtains it indirectly, for the animal</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">from which the meat was taken built up the meat from vegetables. There is</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="429" height="14" font="1">no two ways about this−−all nourishment of the animal and human</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">kingdom is obtained from the vegetable kingdom, directly or indirectly.</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">And the cell action in the child is identical with the cell action in the plant.</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">Cells constantly reproducing themselves and building themselves up into</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">bodily organs, parts, etc., under the direction and guidance of the mind</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">principle. The child grows in this way until the hour of birth. It is born, and</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="413" height="14" font="1">then the process is but slightly changed. The child begins to take</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">nourishment either from the mother's milk or from the milk of the cow, or</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">other forms of food. And as it grows larger it partakes of many different</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">varieties of food. But always it obtains building material from the cell life</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="83" height="14" font="1">of the plants.</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">And this great building up process is intelligent, purposeful, to a wonderful</text>
<text top="735" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">degree. Man with his boasted intellect cannot explain the real &quot;thingness&quot;</text>

<text top="63" left="72" width="451" height="14" font="1">of the process. A leading scientist who placed the egg of a small lizard</text>
<text top="82" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">under microscopical examination and then watched it slowly develop has</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="448" height="14" font="1">said that it seemed as if some hand was tracing the outlines of the tiny</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="438" height="14" font="1">vertebrae, and then building up around it. Think for a moment of the</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="487" height="14" font="1">development of the germ within the egg of the humming−bird, or the ant, or</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">the gnat, or the eagle. Every second a change may be noticed. The germ</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">cell draws to itself nourishment from the other part of the egg, and then it</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">grows and reproduces another cell. Then both cells divide−−then subdivide</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">until there are millions and millions and millions of cells. And all the while</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">the building up process continues, and the bird or insect assumes shape and</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">form, until at last the work is accomplished and the young bird emerges</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="86" height="14" font="1">from the egg.</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">And the work thus commenced continues until the death of the animal. For</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">there is a constant using−up and breaking−down of cell and tissue, which</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="451" height="14" font="1">the organism must replace. And so the vegetative mind of the plant, or</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">insect, or animal, or man, is constantly at work building up new cells from</text>

<text top="159" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">And these messages are natural and free from the abuses and prostitution</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">often observed attached to them by the intellect of man in connection with</text>

<text top="351" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">planes of mind were unfolded, in accordance to the necessity of the living</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">forms. The animal was compelled to hunt for his food−−to prey upon other</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">forms, and to avoid being preyed upon by others. He was compelled to</text>

<text top="447" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">certain things in order to live and reproduce his kind. And he demanded not</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">in vain. For there came to him slowly an unfolding knowledge of the things</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">necessary for the requirements of his life. We call this Instinct. But, pray</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="456" height="14" font="1">remember, by Instinct we do not mean the still higher something that is</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">really rudimentary Intellect that we notice in the higher animals. We are</text>

<text top="313" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">are there. Hate, envy, jealousy, revenge, the lust of the animal seeking the</text>

<text top="370" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">the failure to assert this mastery comes from an ignorance of the nature of</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">the desire, etc. We have been taught that these thoughts were &quot;bad&quot; without</text>

<text top="524" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">beasts loose upon ourselves or others. It was necessary for the animal to be</text>

<text top="562" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">we have outgrown that stage of development, and it is ignoble for us to</text>

<text top="293" left="72" width="419" height="14" font="1">fall back to the animal stage is a &quot;going backward&quot; in the scale of</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">evolution. We intuitively shrink at an exhibition of brutality and animality</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">on the part of a man or woman. We may not know just why, but a little</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">reflection will show us that it is a sinking in the evolutionary scale, against</text>

<text top="293" left="72" width="430" height="14" font="1">and a dangerous doctrine, but it is the Truth. And man instinctively</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">recognizes it. He does not expect the same sense of moral responsibility in</text>

<text top="370" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">welfare of all, but he realizes the distinction, or at least should do so. And</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="456" height="14" font="1">not only is this true, but as man advances in the scale he casts off many</text>

<text top="466" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">Love and Freedom. The ideal condition would be one in which there were</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">no laws and no necessity for them−−a condition in which men had ceased</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">to do wrong because they had outgrown the desire rather than from fear or</text>

<text top="543" left="72" width="456" height="14" font="1">constantly going on an unfoldment of higher planes and faculties of the</text>

<text top="159" left="72" width="456" height="14" font="1">often until the mind knows it so well that it is carried below the field of</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="418" height="14" font="1">consciousness and becomes &quot;second nature,&quot; and akin to Instinct.</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">The text books upon psychology are filled with illustrations and examples</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">of the habit phase or plane of the mental operations, and we do not think it</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">necessary to repeat instances of the same kind here. Everyone is familiar</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">with the fact that tasks which at first are learned only by considerable work</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">and time soon become fixed in some part of the mind until their repetition</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">calls for little or no exercise of conscious mental operation. In fact, some</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">writers have claimed that no one really &quot;learns&quot; how to perform a task until</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">he can perform it almost automatically. The pupil who in the early stages of</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">piano playing finds it most difficult to control and manage his fingers, after</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">a time is able to forget all about his fingering and devote his entire attention</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="445" height="14" font="1">to the pages of his music, and after this he is able to apparently let his</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">fingers play the entire piece of music by themselves without a thought on</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="447" height="14" font="1">his part. The best performers have told us that in the moments of their</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">highest efforts they are aware that the out−of−conscious portion of their</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">mind is doing the work for them, and they are practically standing aside</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">and witnessing the work being done. So true is this that in some cases it is</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">related that if the performer's conscious mind attempts to take up the work</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="434" height="14" font="1">the quality is impaired and the musician and the audience notice the</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="69" height="14" font="1">difference.</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">The same thing is true in the case of the woman learning to operate the</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">sewing machine. It is quite difficult at first, but gradually it grows to &quot;run</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="428" height="14" font="1">itself.&quot; Those who have mastered the typewriter have had the same</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">experience. At first each letter had to be picked out with care and effort.</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">After a gradual improvement the operator is enabled to devote her entire</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">attention to the &quot;copy&quot; and let the fingers pick out the keys for themselves.</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">Many operators learn rapid typewriting by so training the habit mind that it</text>

<text top="140" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">the manipulation than we devote to the operation of walking, which, by the</text>

<text top="178" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">astonishing how many things we do &quot;automatically&quot; in this way. Writers</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="409" height="14" font="1">have called our attention to the fact that the average man cannot</text>

<text top="236" left="72" width="395" height="14" font="1">arm goes in first, how the coat is held, etc. But the habit mind</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">knows−−knows very well. Let the student stand up and put on his coat in</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="443" height="14" font="1">the regular way, following the leadings of the habit mind. Then, after</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">removing it, let him attempt to put it on by inserting the other arm first, for</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">instance. He will be surprised to find out how awkward it will be for him,</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="447" height="14" font="1">and how completely he has been depending upon the habit mind. And</text>

<text top="428" left="72" width="437" height="14" font="1">your collar, reversing the order in which the tabs are placed over the</text>

<text top="466" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">the involuntary protest. Or, try to reverse the customary habit in walking</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">and attempt to swing your right arm with the movement of your right leg,</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">and so on, and you will find it will require the exercise of great will power.</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">Or, try to &quot;change hands&quot; and use your knife and fork. But we must stop</text>

<text top="601" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">takes a hand in our mental operations. We soon acquire the habit of ceasing</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">to consciously consider certain things, and the habit mind takes the matter</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">for granted, and thereafter we will think automatically on those particular</text>

<text top="101" left="72" width="243" height="14" font="1">to get rid of these old outgrown ideas.</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="444" height="14" font="1">There are other planes of mind which have to do with the phenomena</text>

<text top="178" left="72" width="444" height="14" font="1">known as clairvoyance, psychometry, telepathy, etc., but we shall not</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">consider them in this lesson, for they belong to another part of the general</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">subject. We have spoken of them in a general way in our &quot;Fourteen Lessons</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="162" height="14" font="1">in Yogi Philosophy, etc.&quot;</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="450" height="14" font="1">And now we come to the plane of mind known to us as Intellect or the</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">Reasoning Faculties. Webster defines the word Intellect as follows: The</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">part or faculty of the human soul by which it knows, as distinguished from</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">the power to feel and to will; the thinking faculty; the understanding. The</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="431" height="14" font="1">same authority defines the word Reason as follows: &quot;The faculty or</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="417" height="14" font="1">capacity of the human mind by which it is distinguished from the</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="445" height="14" font="1">intelligence of the inferior animals.&quot; We shall not attempt to go into a</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="418" height="14" font="1">consideration of the conscious Intellect, for to do so we would be</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">compelled to take up the space of the remaining lessons of the course, and</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">besides, the student may find extended information on this subject in any of</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">the text books on psychology. Instead we will consider other faculties and</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">planes of mind which the said text books pass by rapidly, or perhaps deny.</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">And one of these planes is that of Unconscious Reasoning, or Intellect. To</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">many this term will seem paradoxical, but students of the unconscious will</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="194" height="14" font="1">understand just what is meant.</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">Reasoning is not necessarily conscious in its operations, in fact, a greater</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">part of the reasoning processes are performed below or above the conscious</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">field. In our last lesson we have given a number of examples proving this</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">fact, but a few more remarks may not be out of place, nor without interest</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="90" height="14" font="1">to the student.</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="417" height="14" font="1">In our last lesson you will see many instances stated in which the</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">sub−conscious field of the Intellect worked out problems, and then after a</text>
<text top="735" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">time handed to the conscious reason the solution of the matter. This has</text>

<text top="121" left="72" width="442" height="14" font="1">The experience is common to the race. While the majority of us have</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">noticed these things, we have regarded them as exceptional and out of the</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">general rule. Not so, however, with students of the mental planes. The latter</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">have recognized these planes of reason, and have availed themselves of</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">their knowledge by setting these unconscious faculties to work for them. In</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="438" height="14" font="1">our next lesson we will give directions to our students regarding this</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">accomplishment, which may prove of the greatest importance to those who</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="448" height="14" font="1">will take the trouble to practice the directions given. It is a plan that is</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">known to the majority of men who have &quot;done things&quot; in the world, the</text>

<text top="313" left="72" width="399" height="14" font="1">the result of a need or demand upon the inner powers of mind.</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">The plane of mind immediately above that of Intellect is that known as</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">Intuition. Intuition is defined by Webster as follows: &quot;Direct apprehension</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">or cognition; immediate knowledge, as in perception or consciousness,</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">involving no reasoning process; quick or ready insight or apprehension.&quot; It</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">is difficult to explain just what is meant by Intuition, except to those who</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="434" height="14" font="1">have experienced it−−and these people do not need the explanation.</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="446" height="14" font="1">Intuition is just as real a mental faculty as is Intellect−−or, to be more</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">exact, is just as much a collection of mental faculties. Intuition is above the</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">field of consciousness, and its messages are passed downward, though its</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="450" height="14" font="1">processes are hidden. The race is gradually unfolding into the plane of</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">Intuition, and the race will some day pass into full consciousness on that</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="456" height="14" font="1">plane. In the meantime it gets but flashes and glimpses from the hidden</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">region. Many of the best things we have come from that region. Art, music,</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">the love of the beautiful and good poetry, the higher form of love, spiritual</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">insight to a certain degree, intuitive perception of truth, etc., etc., come</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">from this region. These things are not reasoned out by the intellect, but</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="416" height="14" font="1">seem to spring full born from some unknown region of the mind.</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="435" height="14" font="1">In this wonderful region dwells Genius. Many, if not all of the great</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">writers, poets, musicians, artists and other examples of genius have felt that</text>
<text top="735" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">their power came to them from some higher source. Many have thought</text>

<text top="82" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">with power and wisdom. Some transcendent power seemed to have been</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">called into operation, and the worker would feel that his product or creation</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">was not his handiwork, but that of some outside intelligence. The Greeks</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">recognized this something in man, and called it man's &quot;Daemon.&quot; Plutarch</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">in his discourse on the daemon that guided Socrates speaks of the vision of</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">Timarchus, who, in the case of Trophonius, saw spirits which were partly</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="428" height="14" font="1">attached to human bodies, and partly over and above them, shining</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">luminously over their heads. He was informed by the oracle that the part of</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">the spirit which was immersed in the body was called the &quot;soul,&quot; but that</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">the outer and unimmersed portion was called the &quot;daemon.&quot; The oracle also</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">informed him that every man had his daemon, whom he is bound to obey;</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="443" height="14" font="1">those who implicitly follow that guidance are the prophetic souls, the</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">favorites of the gods. Goethe also spoke of the daemon as a power higher</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">than the will, and which inspired certain natures with miraculous energy.</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">We may smile at these conceptions, but they are really very close to the</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">truth. The higher regions of the mind, while belonging to the individual,</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">and a part of himself, are so far above his ordinary consciousness that to all</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">intents and purposes messages from them are as orders from another and</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="437" height="14" font="1">higher soul. But still the voice is that of the &quot;I,&quot; speaking through its</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="156" height="14" font="1">sheaths as best it is able.</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">This power belongs to every one of us, although it manifests only in the</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">degree that we are able to respond to it. It grows by faith and confidence,</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">and closes itself up, and withdraws into its recesses when we doubt it and</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">would question its veracity and reality. What we call &quot;originality&quot; comes</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">from this region. The Intuitive faculties pass on to the conscious mind some</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">perception of truth higher than the Intellect has been able to work out for</text>

<text top="101" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">Spirit.&quot; This is a far different thing from being led by outside intelligence,</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">which may, or may not, be qualified to lead. But the Spirit within each of</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">us has our interests at heart and is desirous of our best good, and is not only</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">ready but willing to take us by the hand and lead us on. The Higher Self is</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">doing the best it can for our development and welfare, but is hampered by</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="449" height="14" font="1">the confining sheaths. And alas, many of us glory in these sheaths and</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">consider them the highest part of ourselves. Do not be afraid to let the light</text>

<text top="274" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">communication to us. There are other and still higher planes of mind, but</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">the Intuition is the one next in the line of unfoldment, and we should open</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="349" height="14" font="1">ourselves to its influence and welcome its unfoldment.</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">Above the plane of Intuition is that of the Cosmic Knowing, upon which</text>

<text top="447" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">all the countless forms and shapes of manifestation. He is able to see that</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">separateness is only &quot;the working fiction of the Universe.&quot; He is able to see</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="438" height="14" font="1">that each Ego is but a Centre of Consciousness in the great Ocean of</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">Life−−all in pursuance of the Divine Plan, and that he is moving forward</text>

<text top="430" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">In the Ninth Lesson we called your attention to the fact that Reasoning was</text>
<text top="449" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">not necessarily conscious in its operations, and that, in fact, a large part of</text>
<text top="468" left="72" width="487" height="14" font="1">the rational processes of the mind are performed below or above the field of</text>
<text top="487" left="72" width="428" height="14" font="1">consciousness. And in the Eighth Lesson we gave you a number of</text>
<text top="507" left="72" width="447" height="14" font="1">examples illustrating this fact. We also gave you a number of cases in</text>
<text top="526" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">which the sub−conscious field of the Intellect worked out problems, and</text>
<text top="545" left="72" width="432" height="14" font="1">then after a time passed on to the conscious field of the Intellect the</text>
<text top="564" left="72" width="448" height="14" font="1">solution of the matter. In this lesson we purpose instructing you in the</text>
<text top="583" left="72" width="451" height="14" font="1">methods by which this part of the Intellect may be set to work for you.</text>
<text top="603" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">Many have stumbled upon bits of this truth for themselves, and, in fact, the</text>
<text top="622" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">majority of successful men and men who have attained eminence in any</text>
<text top="641" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">walk of life have made more or less use of this truth, although they seldom</text>
<text top="660" left="72" width="174" height="14" font="1">understand the reason of it.</text>
<text top="699" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">Very few Western writers have recognized the work of this plane of the</text>
<text top="718" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">mind. They have given us full and ingenious theories and examples of the</text>
<text top="737" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">workings of the Instinctive Mind, and in some cases they have touched</text>

<text top="82" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">every case they have treated the Intellect as something entirely confined to</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="456" height="14" font="1">the Conscious plane of mentation. In this they have missed some of the</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">most interesting and valuable manifestations of sub−conscious mentation.</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">In this lesson we will take up this particular phase of mentation, and trust to</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">be able to point out the way to use it to the best advantage, giving some</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="451" height="14" font="1">simple instructions that have been given by the Hindu teachers to their</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">students for centuries past, such instructions of course, being modified by</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">us to conform to the requirements and necessities of the Western student of</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="40" height="14" font="1">today.</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="443" height="14" font="1">We have taken the liberty of bestowing a new title upon this phase of</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="456" height="14" font="1">mentation−−we have thought it well to call it &quot;Sub−consciousing.&quot; The</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">word &quot;Sub,&quot; of course means &quot;under; below;&quot; and the word &quot;Consciousing&quot;</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">is a favorite term employed by Prof. Elmer Gates, and means receiving</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">impressions from the mind. In a general way, &quot;Sub−consciousing,&quot; as used</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">in this lesson, may be understood to mean &quot;using the subconscious mind,</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="236" height="14" font="1">under orders of the conscious mind.&quot;</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">By referring to our Eighth Lesson, we see mention made of the case of the</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">man who indulged in &quot;unconscious rumination,&quot; which happened to him</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">when he read books presenting new points of view essentially opposed to</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">his previous opinion. You will note that after days, weeks, or months, he</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="424" height="14" font="1">found that to his great astonishment the old opinions were entirely</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="251" height="14" font="1">rearranged, and new ones lodged there.</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="419" height="14" font="1">On the same page you will see mentioned the case of Sir William</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">Hamilton, who discovered an important law of mathematics while walking</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">with his wife. In this case he had been previously thinking of the missing</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">link in his chain of reasoning, and the problem was worked out for him by</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="257" height="14" font="1">the sub−conscious plane of his Intellect.</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="419" height="14" font="1">On the same page, and the one following, is found the case of Dr.</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">Thompson, who gives an interesting account of the workings of this part of</text>
<text top="735" left="72" width="423" height="14" font="1">his mind, which caused him at times to experience a feeling of the</text>

<text top="63" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">uselessness of all voluntary effort, coupled with a feeling that the matter</text>
<text top="82" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">was working itself clear in his mind. He tells us that at times he seemed to</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="450" height="14" font="1">be merely a passive instrument in the hands of some person other than</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">himself, who compelled him to wait until the work was performed for him</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">by some hidden region of the mind. When the subconscious part of the</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">mind had completed its work, it would flash the message to his conscious</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="224" height="14" font="1">mind, and he would begin to write.</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">On page 178 mention is also made of the great French chemist Berthelot,</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="456" height="14" font="1">who relates that some of his best conceptions have flashed upon him as</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="428" height="14" font="1">from the clear sky. In fact, the Eighth Lesson is largely made up of</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">examples of this kind, and we ask the student to re−read the same, in order</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">to refresh his mind with the truth of the workings of the sub−conscious</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="64" height="14" font="1">mentality.</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">But you will notice in nearly all the cases mentioned, that those who related</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">instances of the help of the sub−conscious mind had merely stumbled upon</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">the fact that there was a part of the mind below consciousness that could</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="435" height="14" font="1">and would work out problems for one, if it could somehow be set in</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">operation. And these people trusted to luck to start that part of the mind in</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">operation. Or rather, they would saturate their conscious mind with a mass</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="413" height="14" font="1">of material, like stuffing the stomach with food, and then bid the</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">subconscious mind assort, separate, arrange and digest the mental food, just</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="396" height="14" font="1">as does the stomach and digestive apparatus digest the natural</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">food−−outside of the realm of consciousness or volition. In none of the</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">cases mentioned was the subconscious mind<i> directed</i> specially to perform</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">its wonderful work. It was simply hoped that it might digest the mental</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">material with which it had been stuffed−−in pure self defense. But there is a</text>

<text top="121" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">student or Yogi rests assured that the desired result will be forthcoming in</text>

<text top="159" left="72" width="427" height="14" font="1">and busies himself with other matters, knowing that day and night,</text>

<text top="293" left="72" width="201" height="14" font="1">stumbled upon bits of the truth.</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">The Yogi teacher begins by impressing upon his students the fact that the</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">mind is capable of extending outward toward an object, material or mental,</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">and by examining it by methods inherent in itself, extracting knowledge</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="456" height="14" font="1">regarding the object named. This is not a startling truth, because it is so</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">common, everyone employing it more or less every day. But the process by</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="420" height="14" font="1">which the knowledge is extracted is most wonderful, and really is</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="456" height="14" font="1">performed below the plane of consciousness, the work of the conscious</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">mind being chiefly concerned in<i> holding the Attention</i> upon the object. We</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">have spoken of the importance of Attention in previous lessons, which it</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="279" height="14" font="1">will be well for you to re−read, at this time.</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="442" height="14" font="1">When the student is fully impressed with the details of the process of</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">Attention, and the subsequent unfoldment of knowledge, the Yogi proceeds</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">to inform him that there are other means of obtaining knowledge about an</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">object, by the employment of which the Attention may be firmly directed</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">toward the object and then afterwards held there _unconsciously_−−that is,</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">a portion of the Attention, or a sub−conscious phase of mentation, which</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">will hold the sub−conscious mind firmly upon the work until accomplished,</text>

<text top="63" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">The Yogis teach the students that this new form of Attention is far more</text>
<text top="82" left="72" width="441" height="14" font="1">intense and powerful than is the conscious Attention, for it cannot be</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">disturbed or shaken, or distracted from its object, and that it will work away</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">at its task for days, months, years, or a lifetime if necessary, according to</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">the difficulty of the task, and in fact carries its work over from one life to</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="423" height="14" font="1">another, unless recalled by the Will. They teach the student that in</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="400" height="14" font="1">everyone's life there is going on a greater or less degree of this</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="425" height="14" font="1">sub−conscious work, carried on in obedience to a strong desire for</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">knowledge manifested in some former life, and bearing fruit only in the</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="421" height="14" font="1">present existence. Many important discoveries have been made in</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">obedience to this law. But it is not of this phase of the matter that we wish</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="144" height="14" font="1">to speak in this lesson.</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">The Yogi theory is that the sub−conscious intellectual faculty may be set to</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">work under the direction of orders given by the Will. All of you know how</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">the sub−conscious mentality will take up an order of the Will, or a strong</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">wish, that the person be awakened at a certain hour in order to catch a train.</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">Or, in the same way how the remembrance of a certain engagement at, say,</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">four o'clock, will flash into the mind when the hands of the clock approach</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">the stated hour. Nearly every one can recall instances of this sort in his own</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="73" height="14" font="1">experience.</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="437" height="14" font="1">But the Yogis go much further than this. They claim that any and all</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">faculties of the mind may be &quot;set going,&quot; or working on any problem, if</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">ordered thereto by the Will. In fact, the Yogis, and their advanced students</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="414" height="14" font="1">have mastered this art to such a surprising extent that they find it</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="446" height="14" font="1">unnecessary to do the drudgery of thinking in the conscious field, and</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">prefer to relegate such mental work to the sub−conscious, reserving their</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">conscious work for the consideration of digested information and thought</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="297" height="14" font="1">presented to them by the sub−conscious mind.</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">Their directions to their students cover a great deal of ground, and extend</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="405" height="14" font="1">over a long period of time, and many of the directions are quite</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">complicated and full of detail. But we think that we can give our students</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">an abbreviated and condensed idea in a few pages of the lesson. And the</text>
<text top="735" left="72" width="447" height="14" font="1">remaining lessons of the course will also throw additional light on the</text>

<text top="101" left="72" width="416" height="14" font="1">The Yogi takes the student when the latter is much bothered by a</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">consideration of some knotty and perplexing philosophical subject. He bids</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="487" height="14" font="1">the student relax every muscle,−−take the tension from every nerve−−throw</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">aside all mental strain, and then wait a few moments. Then the student is</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">instructed to grasp the subject which he has had before his mind firmly and</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">fixedly before his mental vision, by means of concentration. Then he is</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">instructed to pass it on to the sub−conscious mentality by an effort of the</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">Will, which effort is aided by forming a mental picture of the subject as a</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">material substance, _or bundle of thought,_ which is being bodily lifted up</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">and dropped down a mental hatch−way, or trap−door, in which it sinks</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="443" height="14" font="1">from sight. The student is then instructed to say to the sub−conscious</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">mentality: &quot;I wish this subject thoroughly analyzed, arranged, classified</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="447" height="14" font="1">(and whatever else is desired) and then the results handed back to me.</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="98" height="14" font="1">Attend to this.&quot;</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">The student is taught to speak to the sub−conscious mentality just as if it</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">were a separate entity of being, which had been employed to do the work.</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="446" height="14" font="1">He is also taught that<i> confident expectation</i> is an important part of the</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">process, and that the degree of success depends upon the degree of this</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="142" height="14" font="1">confident expectation.</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">In obstinate cases, the student is taught to use the Imagination freely, until</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">he is able to make a mental image or picture of the sub−conscious mind</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">doing what is required of it. This process clears away a mental path for the</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">feet of the sub−conscious mind, which it will choose thereafter, as it prefers</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="232" height="14" font="1">to follow the line of least resistance.</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="487" height="14" font="1">Of course much depends upon practice−−practice makes perfect, you know,</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="437" height="14" font="1">in everything else, and sub−consciousing is no exception to the rule.</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">The student gradually acquires a proficiency in the art of sub−consciousing,</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">and thereafter devotes his time to acquiring new facts for mental digestion,</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="389" height="14" font="1">rather than bestowing it upon the mechanical act of thinking.</text>

<text top="63" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">But a very important point to be remembered is that the Will−power back</text>
<text top="82" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">of the transferred thought−material, which Will−power is the cause of the</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">subconscious action, depends very greatly upon the attention and interest</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">given to the acquired material. This mass of thought−material which is to</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">be digested, and threshed out by the sub−conscious mind, must be well</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">saturated with interest and attention, in order to obtain the best results. In</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="447" height="14" font="1">fact interest and attention are such important aids to the Will, that any</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="437" height="14" font="1">consideration of the development and acquirement of Will−power is</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">practically a development and acquirement of attention and interest. The</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="414" height="14" font="1">student is referred to previous lessons in this course in which the</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="405" height="14" font="1">importance of interest and attention is explained and described.</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">In acquiring the mass of thought−material which is to be passed on to the</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">sub−conscious digestion, one must concentrate a great degree of interest</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="429" height="14" font="1">and attention upon each item of thought−material gathered up. The</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">gathering of this thought−material is a matter of the greatest importance,</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">and must not be lightly passed by. One cannot hastily gather together all</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">sorts of thought−material, and then expect the subconscious mind to do its</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">work properly−−it will not, in fact, and the student proceeding upon any</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="368" height="14" font="1">such erroneous supposition is doomed to disappointment.</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">The proper way to proceed, is to take up each bit of thought−material in</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">turn, and examine it with the greatest possible interest, and consequently</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="450" height="14" font="1">the greatest attention, and then after having fairly saturated it with this</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">interested attention, place it with the pile of material which, after a while, is</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">to be passed on to the sub−conscious mentality. Then take up the next bit of</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">material, and after giving it similar treatment, pass it along to the pile also.</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">Then after a while when you have gathered up the main facts of the case,</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">proceed to consider the mass as a whole, with interest and attention, giving</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">it as it were a &quot;general treatment.&quot; Then drop it down the trap−door into the</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="392" height="14" font="1">sub−conscious mind, with a strong command, &quot;Attend to this</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">thought−material,&quot; coupled with a strong expectant belief that your order</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="98" height="14" font="1">will be obeyed.</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">The idea underlying this treatment of the thought−material with interest and</text>

<text top="82" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">passing on &quot;thoughts&quot; for the sub−consciousness to act upon, and that the</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">more tangible and real these thoughts are, the better can they be handled.</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">Therefore any plan that will build these thoughts up into &quot;real&quot; things is the</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="418" height="14" font="1">plan to pursue. And attention and interest produce just this result.</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">If we may be pardoned for using a homely and commonplace illustration</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">we would say that the idea may be grasped by the illustration of boiling an</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">egg, whereby the fluid &quot;white&quot; and &quot;yolk&quot; becomes solid and real. Also the</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="445" height="14" font="1">use of a shaving brush by a man, by which the thin lather is gradually</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">worked up into a rich, thick, creamy mass, is an illustration. Again, the</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">churning of butter is a favorite illustration of the Hindus, who thus call the</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">attention of their students to the fact that thought−material if worked upon</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">with attention and interest become &quot;thought−forms&quot; that may be handled by</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">the mind just as the hands handle a material object. We ask you to think of</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">these illustrations, for when you once grasp the idea that we wish to convey</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">to you, you will have the secret of great thinking powers within your grasp.</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="413" height="14" font="1">And this power of sub−consciousing is not confined alone to the</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">consideration of philosophical questions. On the contrary it is applicable to</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">every field of human thought, and may be properly employed in any and all</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">of them. It is useful in solving the problems of every−day life and work, as</text>

<text top="178" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">In some cases the matter will be worked out by the sub−conscious mind in</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">a very short time, and in fact we have known cases in which the answer</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">would be flashed back almost instantly, almost like an inspiration. But in</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="451" height="14" font="1">the majority of cases more or less time is required. The sub−conscious</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">mind works very rapidly, but it takes time to arrange the thought−material</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">properly, and to shape it into the desired forms. In the majority of cases it is</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">well to let the matter rest until the next day−−a fact that gives us a clue to</text>

<text top="389" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">before the conscious mind for review. You will find that it has shaped itself</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">up considerably, and is assuming definite form and clearness. But right</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">here−−and this is important−−do not make the mistake of again dissecting</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">it, and meddling with it, and trying to arrange it with your conscious mind.</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">But, instead, give it attention and interest in its new form, and then pass it</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">back again to the sub−conscious mind for further work. You will find an</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">improvement each time you examine it. But, right here another word of</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="444" height="14" font="1">caution. Do not make the mistake of yielding to the impatience of the</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="449" height="14" font="1">beginner, and keep on repeatedly bringing up the matter to see what is</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">being done. Give it time to have the work done on it. Do not be like the boy</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">who planted seeds, and who each day would pull them up to see whether</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="220" height="14" font="1">they had sprouted, and how much.</text>

<text top="82" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">The secret is that the sub−conscious mind with its wonderful patience and</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">care has analyzed the matter, and has separated things before apparently</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="432" height="14" font="1">connected. It has also found resemblances and has combined things</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">heretofore considered opposed to each other. In short it has done for you all</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">that you could have done with the expenditure of great work and time, and</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">done it well. And then it lays the matter before you for your consideration</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="76" height="14" font="1">and verdict.</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">Its whole work seems to have been in the nature of assorting, dissecting,</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">analyzing, and arranging the evidence, and then presenting it before you in</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="434" height="14" font="1">a clear, systematic shape. It does not attempt to exercise the judicial</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="487" height="14" font="1">prerogative or function, but seems to recognize that its work ceases with the</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">presentation of the edited evidence, and that of the conscious mind begins</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="113" height="14" font="1">at the same point.</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">Now, do not confuse this work with that of the Intuition, which is a very</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="422" height="14" font="1">different mental phase or plane. This sub−conscious working, just</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">mentioned, plays an entirely different part. It is a good servant, and does</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="451" height="14" font="1">not try to be more. The Intuition, on the contrary, is more like a higher</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">friend−−a friend at court, as it were, who gives us warnings and advice.</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="487" height="14" font="1">In our directions we have told you how to make use of this part of the mind,</text>

<text top="524" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">worry and anxiety attendant upon unsettled questions. But, in fact, every</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">one of us makes more or less use of this part of the mind unconsciously,</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="445" height="14" font="1">and not realizing the important part it plays in our mental life. We are</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">perplexed about a matter and keep it &quot;on our minds&quot; until we are forced to</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="452" height="14" font="1">lay it aside by reason of some other demand, or when we sink to sleep.</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">Often to our surprise we will find that when we next think of it the matter</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">has somehow cleared up and straightened itself out, and we seem to have</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="429" height="14" font="1">learned something about it that we did not know before. We do not</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">understand it, and are apt to dismiss it as &quot;just one of those things.&quot; In these</text>

<text top="63" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">Now to apply the rule to another case. Suppose you wish to gather together</text>
<text top="82" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">all the information that you possess relating to a certain subject. In the first</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">place it is certain that you know a very great deal more about any subject</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">than you think you do. Stored away in the various recesses of the mind, or</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="487" height="14" font="1">memory if you prefer that term, are stray bits of information and knowledge</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="434" height="14" font="1">concerning almost any subject. But these bits of information are not</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">associated with each other. You have never attempted to think attentively</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">upon the particular question before you, and the facts are not correlated in</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="444" height="14" font="1">the mind. It is just as if you had so many hundred pounds of anything</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">scattered throughout the space of a large warehouse, a tiny bit here, and a</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="352" height="14" font="1">tiny bit there, mixed up with thousands of other things.</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">You may prove this by sitting down some time and letting your thoughts</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">run along the line of some particular subject, and you will find emerging</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="428" height="14" font="1">into the field of consciousness all sorts of information that you had</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="451" height="14" font="1">apparently forgotten, and each fitting itself into its proper place. Every</text>

<text top="447" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="3"><i>always</i> does the work, even when you think it is the conscious mind. All</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="451" height="14" font="1">the conscious mind does is to hold the attention firmly upon the object</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">before it, and then let the sub−consciousness pass the material before it. But</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">this holding the attention is tiresome work, and it is not necessary for it to</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">expend its energies upon the details of the task, for the work may be done</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="187" height="14" font="1">in an easier and simpler way.</text>

<text top="178" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">many business men and men of affairs have stumbled upon a similar plan,</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="386" height="14" font="1">driven to the discovery by necessity. They will give a quick,</text>

<text top="351" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">knowledge, and are what is known as &quot;resourceful.&quot; Such men are often</text>

<text top="409" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">confidence at such moments, and has also impressed upon them the truth</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="439" height="14" font="1">that something within them will come to the rescue. So, presenting a</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">confident air, they will manage to say a few platitudes or commonplaces,</text>

<text top="485" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">answer. In a moment an opening thought &quot;flashes upon&quot; the man, and as he</text>

<text top="236" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">sufficient for the sub−conscious mind to gather up its materials, and the</text>

<text top="274" left="72" width="431" height="14" font="1">part of the answerer. All of this required practice, of course, but the</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">principle may be seen through it all and in every similar case. The point is</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">that the man, in such cases, sets some hidden part of his mind to work for</text>

<text top="428" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">principle. We have known other men to twirl a lead pencil in their fingers</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">in a lazy sort of fashion, and then drop it at the important moment. But we</text>

<text top="505" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">The impressive pause of the teacher, before answering his pupil's question,</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">is also an example of the workings of this law. One often says &quot;stop, let me</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">think a moment,&quot; and during his pause he does not really consciously think</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">at all, but stares ahead in a dreamy fashion, while his sub−conscious mind</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="424" height="14" font="1">does the work for him, although he little suspects the nature of the</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">operation. One has but to look around him to realize the importance and</text>

<text top="199" left="72" width="432" height="14" font="1">In our last lesson (the Tenth Lesson) we called your attention to the</text>
<text top="219" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">wonderful work of the sub−conscious regions of mentation in the direction</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">of the performance of Intellectual work. Great as are the possibilities of this</text>
<text top="257" left="72" width="419" height="14" font="1">field of mentation in the direction named, they are equaled by the</text>
<text top="276" left="72" width="364" height="14" font="1">possibilities of building up character by similar methods.</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">Every one realizes that one may change his character by a strenuous course</text>
<text top="334" left="72" width="427" height="14" font="1">of repression and training, and nearly all who read these lines have</text>
<text top="353" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">modified their characteristics somewhat by similar methods. But it is only</text>
<text top="372" left="72" width="449" height="14" font="1">of late years that the general public have become aware that Character</text>
<text top="391" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">might be modified, changed, and sometimes completely altered by means</text>
<text top="411" left="72" width="406" height="14" font="1">of an intelligent use of the sub−conscious faculties of the mind.</text>
<text top="449" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">The word &quot;Character&quot; is derived from ancient terms meaning &quot;to mark,&quot; &quot;to</text>
<text top="468" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">engrave,&quot; etc., and some authorities inform us that the term originally arose</text>
<text top="487" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">from the word used by the Babylonian brickmakers to designate the trade</text>
<text top="507" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">mark impressed by them upon their bricks, each maker having his own</text>
<text top="526" left="72" width="439" height="14" font="1">mark. This is interesting, in view of the recent theories regarding the</text>
<text top="545" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">cultivation of characteristics which may be found in the current Western</text>
<text top="564" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">works on psychology. But these theories are not new to the Yogi teachers</text>
<text top="583" left="72" width="443" height="14" font="1">of the East, who have employed similar methods for centuries past in</text>
<text top="603" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">training their students and pupils. The Yogis have long taught that a man's</text>
<text top="622" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">character was, practically, the crude character−stuff possessed by him at his</text>
<text top="641" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">birth, modified and shaped by outside influences in the case of the ordinary</text>
<text top="660" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">man, and by deliberate self−training and shaping by the wise man. Their</text>
<text top="679" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">pupils are examined regarding their characteristics, and then directed to</text>
<text top="699" left="72" width="412" height="14" font="1">repress the undesirable traits, and to cultivate the desirable ones.</text>

<text top="63" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">The Yogi practice of Character Building is based upon the knowledge of</text>
<text top="82" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">the wonderful powers of the sub−conscious plane of the mind. The pupil is</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">not required to pursue strenuous methods of repression or cultivation, but,</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">on the contrary, is taught that such methods are opposed to nature's plans,</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">and that the best way is to imitate nature and to gradually unfold the desired</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">characteristics by means of focusing the will−power and attention upon</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">them. The weeding out of undesirable characteristics is accomplished by</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">the pupil cultivating the characteristics directly opposed to the undesirable</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="421" height="14" font="1">ones. For instance, if the pupil desires to overcome Fear, he is not</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">instructed to concentrate on Fear with the idea of killing it out, but, instead,</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="451" height="14" font="1">is taught to mentally deny that he has Fear, and then to concentrate his</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">attention upon the ideal of Courage. When Courage is developed, Fear is</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">found to have faded away. The positive always overpowers the negative.</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="389" height="14" font="1">In the word &quot;ideal&quot; is found the secret of the Yogi method of</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="444" height="14" font="1">sub−conscious character building. The teachings are to the effect that</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="441" height="14" font="1">&quot;ideals&quot; may be built up by the bestowal of attention upon them. The</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">student is given the example of a rose bush. He is taught that the plant will</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">grow and flourish in the measure that care and attention is bestowed upon it</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">and<i> vice versa</i>. He is taught that the ideal of some desired characteristic is a</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">mental rosebush, and that by careful attention it will grow and put forth</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">leaves and flowers. He is then given some minor mental trait to develop,</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">and is taught to dwell upon it in thought−−to exercise his imagination and</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="425" height="14" font="1">to mentally &quot;see&quot; himself attaining the desired quality. He is given</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">mantrams or affirmation to repeat, for the purpose of giving him a mental</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">center around which to build an ideal. There is a mighty power in words,</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">used in this way, providing that the user always thinks of the meaning of</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">the words, and makes a mental picture of the quality expressed by them,</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="308" height="14" font="1">instead of merely repeating them parrot fashion.</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="437" height="14" font="1">The Yogi student is trained gradually, until he acquires the power of</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">conscious direction of the sub−conscious mind in the building up process,</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">which power comes to anyone−−Oriental or Occidental−−who will take the</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">trouble to practice. In fact, nearly everyone possesses and actively uses this</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">power, although he may not be aware of it. One's character is largely the</text>
<text top="735" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">result of the quality of thoughts held in the mind, and of the mental pictures</text>

<text top="82" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">of himself as unsuccessful and down−trodden is very apt to grow ideals of</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">thought forms of these things until his whole nature is dominated by them,</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">and his every act works toward the objectification of the thoughts. On the</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">contrary, the man who makes an ideal of success and accomplishment finds</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="431" height="14" font="1">that his whole mental nature seems to work toward that result−−the</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">objectification of the ideal. And so it is with every other ideal. The person</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">who builds up a mental ideal of Jealousy will be very apt to objectify the</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">same, and to unconsciously create condition that will give his Jealousy food</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="439" height="14" font="1">upon which to feed. But this particular phase of the subject, properly</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">belongs to our next lesson. This Eleventh Lesson is designed to point out</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="444" height="14" font="1">the way by which people may mould their characters in any way they</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="450" height="14" font="1">desire−−supplanting undesirable characteristics by desirable ones, and</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">developing desirable ideals into active characteristics. The mind is plastic</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="312" height="14" font="1">to him who knows the secret of its manipulation.</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">The average person recognizes his strong and weak points of character, but</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">is very apt to regard them as fixed and unalterable, or practically so. He</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">thinks that he &quot;is just as the Lord made him,&quot; and that is the end of it. He</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">fails to recognize that his character is being unconsciously modified every</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">day by association with others, whose suggestions are being absorbed and</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">acted upon. And he fails to see that he is moulding his own character by</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">taking interest in certain things, and allowing his mind to dwell upon them.</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">He does not realize that he himself is really the maker of himself, from the</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">raw and crude material given him at his birth. He makes himself negatively</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="432" height="14" font="1">or positively. Negatively, if he allows himself to be moulded by the</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="426" height="14" font="1">thoughts and ideals of others, and positively, if he moulds himself.</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">Everyone is doing one or the other−−perhaps both. The weak man is the</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">one who allows himself to be made by others, and the strong man is the one</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="313" height="14" font="1">who takes the building process in his own hands.</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="428" height="14" font="1">The process of Character−building is so delightfully simple that its</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="449" height="14" font="1">importance is apt to be overlooked by the majority of persons who are</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">made acquainted with it. It is only by actual practice and the experiencing</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="408" height="14" font="1">of results that its wonderful possibilities are borne home to one.</text>

<text top="63" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">The Yogi student is early taught the lesson of the power and importance of</text>
<text top="82" left="72" width="449" height="14" font="1">character building by some strong practical example. For instance, the</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">student is found to have certain tastes of appetite, such as a like for certain</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">things, and a corresponding dislike for others. The Yogi teacher instructs</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">the student in the direction of cultivating a desire and taste for the disliked</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">thing, and a dislike for the liked thing. He teaches the student to fix his</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">mind on the two things, but in the direction of imagining that he likes the</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="456" height="14" font="1">one thing and dislikes the other. The student is taught to make a mental</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="425" height="14" font="1">picture of the desired conditions, and to say, for instance, &quot;I loathe</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">candy−−I dislike even the sight of it,&quot; and, on the other hand, &quot;I crave tart</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">things−−I revel in the taste of them,&quot; etc., etc., at the same time trying to</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">reproduce the taste of sweet things accompanied with a loathing, and a taste</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">of tart things, accompanied with a feeling of delight. After a bit the student</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">finds that his tastes are actually changing in accordance with his thoughts,</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">and in the end they have completely changed places. The truth of the theory</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="422" height="14" font="1">is then borne home to the student, and he never forgets the lesson.</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">In order to reassure readers who might object to having the student left in</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">this condition of reversed tastes, we may add that the Yogi teachers then</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="443" height="14" font="1">teach him to get rid of the idea of the disliked thing, and teach him to</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="444" height="14" font="1">cultivate a liking for all wholesome things, their theory being that the</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">dislike of certain wholesome eatables has been caused by some suggestion</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">in childhood, or by some prenatal impression, as wholesome eatables are</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="425" height="14" font="1">made attractive to the taste by Nature. The idea of all this training,</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">however, is not the cultivation of taste, but practice in mental training, and</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="444" height="14" font="1">the bringing home to the student the truth of the fact that his nature is</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">plastic to his Ego, and that it may be moulded at will, by concentration and</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">intelligent practice. The reader of this lesson may experiment upon himself</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">along the lines of the elementary Yogi practice as above mentioned, if he so</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">desires. He will find it possible to entirely change his dislike for certain</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">food, etc., by the methods mentioned above. He may likewise acquire a</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">liking for heretofore distasteful tasks and duties, which he finds it necessary</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="72" height="14" font="1">to perform.</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">The principle underlying the whole Yogi theory of Character Building by</text>

<text top="63" left="72" width="444" height="14" font="1">the mind is plastic to the commands of the Ego. The Ego or &quot;I&quot; of the</text>
<text top="82" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">individual is the one real, permanent, changeless principle of the individual,</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">and the mind, like the body, is constantly changing, moving, growing, and</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="443" height="14" font="1">dying. Just as the body may be developed and moulded by intelligent</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="424" height="14" font="1">exercises, so may the mind be developed and shaped by the Ego if</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="212" height="14" font="1">intelligent methods are followed.</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="437" height="14" font="1">The majority of people consider that Character is a fixed something,</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">belonging to a man, that cannot be altered or changed. And yet they show</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">by their everyday actions that at heart they do not believe this to be a fact,</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="487" height="14" font="1">for they endeavor to change and mould the characters of those around them,</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="375" height="14" font="1">by word of advice, counsel, praising or condemnation, etc.</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">It is not necessary to go into the matter of the consideration of the causes of</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="451" height="14" font="1">character in this lesson. We will content ourselves by saying that these</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">causes may be summed up, roughly, as follows: (1) Result of experiences</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">in past lives; (2) Heredity; (3) Environment; (4) Suggestion from others;</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="445" height="14" font="1">and (5) Auto−suggestion. But no matter how one's character has been</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="441" height="14" font="1">formed, it may be modified, moulded, changed, and improved by the</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">methods set forth in this lesson, which methods are similar to what is called</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="256" height="14" font="1">by Western writers, &quot;Auto−suggestion.&quot;</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">The underlying idea of Auto−suggestion is the &quot;willing&quot; of the individual</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="423" height="14" font="1">that the changes take place in his mind, the willing being aided by</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">intelligent and tried methods of creating the new ideal or thought−form.</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="437" height="14" font="1">The first requisite for the changed condition must be &quot;desire&quot; for the</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">change. Unless one really desires that the change take place, he is unable to</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">bring his Will to bear on the task. There is a very close connection between</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">Desire and Will. Will is not usually brought to bear upon anything unless it</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">is inspired by Desire. Some people connect the word Desire with the lower</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">inclinations, but it is equally applicable to the higher. If one fights off a low</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">inclination or Desire, it is because he is possessed of a higher inclination or</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="432" height="14" font="1">Desire. Many Desires are really compromises between two or more</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="365" height="14" font="1">conflicting Desires−−a sort of average Desire, as it were.</text>

<text top="63" left="72" width="448" height="14" font="1">Unless one desires to change his character he will not make any move</text>
<text top="82" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">toward it. And in proportion to the strength of the desire, so will be the</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">amount of will−power that is put in the task. The first thing for one to do in</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">character building is to &quot;want to do it.&quot; And if he finds that the &quot;want&quot; is</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">not sufficiently strong to enable him to manifest the perseverance and effort</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">necessary to bring it to a successful conclusion, then he should deliberately</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="207" height="14" font="1">proceed to &quot;build up the desire.&quot;</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">Desire may be built up by allowing the mind to dwell upon the subject until</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">a desire is created. This rule works both ways, as many people have found</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">out to their sorrow and misery. Not only may one build up a commendable</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">desire in this way, but he may also build up a reprehensible one. A little</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="452" height="14" font="1">thought will show you the truth of this statement. A young man has no</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">desire to indulge in the excesses of a &quot;fast&quot; life. But after a while he hears,</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">or reads something about others leading that sort of life, and he begins to</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">allow his mind to dwell upon the subject, turning it around and examining</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">it mentally, and going over it in his imagination. After a time he begins to</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">find a desire gradually sending forth roots and branches, and if he continues</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="436" height="14" font="1">to water the thing in his imagination, before long he will find within</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">himself a blossoming inclination, which will try to insist upon expression in</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="371" height="14" font="1">action. There is a great truth behind the words of the poet:</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">&quot;Vice is a monster of so frightful mien, That to be hated needs but to be</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">seen. Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face, We first endure, then pity,</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="123" height="14" font="1">and then embrace.&quot;</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">And the follies and crimes of many a man have been due to the growing of</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="452" height="14" font="1">desire within his mind, through this plan of planting the seed, and then</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">carefully watering and tending to it−−this cultivation of the growing desire.</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">We have thought it well to give this word of warning because it will throw</text>

<text top="121" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">then you should commence by planting the desire seed and allowing it to</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="433" height="14" font="1">grow by giving it constant care and attention. You should picture to</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="451" height="14" font="1">yourself the advantages of acquiring the desirable traits of character of</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">which you have thought. You should frequently go over and over them in</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">your mind, imaging yourself in imagination as possessing them. You will</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="449" height="14" font="1">then find that the growing desire will make headway and that you will</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">gradually begin to &quot;want to&quot; possess that trait of character more and more.</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">And when you begin to &quot;want to&quot; hard enough, you will find arising in your</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">consciousness a feeling of the possession of sufficient Will−power to carry</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">it through. Will follows the Desire. Cultivate a Desire and you will find</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">back of it the Will to carry it through. Under the pressure of a very strong</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="344" height="14" font="1">Desire men have accomplished feats akin to miracles.</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">If you find yourself in possession of desires that you feel are hurtful to you,</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">you may rid yourself of them by deliberately starving them to death, and at</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="430" height="14" font="1">the same time growing opposite desires. By refusing to think of the</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">objectionable desires you refuse them the mental food upon which alone</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">they can thrive. Just as you starve a plant by refusing it nourishing soil and</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">water, so may you starve out an objectionable desire by refusing to give it</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">mental food. _Remember this, for it is most important_. Refuse to allow the</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">mind to dwell upon such desires, and resolutely turn aside the attention,</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">_and, particularly, the imagination_, from the subject. This may call for the</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">manifestation of a little will−power in the beginning, but it will become</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">easier as you progress, and each victory will give you renewed strength for</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">the next fight. But do not temporize with the desire−−do not compromise</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">with it−−refuse to entertain the idea. In a fight of this kind each victory</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="356" height="14" font="1">gives one added strength, and each defeat weakens one.</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">And while you are refusing to entertain the objectionable guest you must be</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="445" height="14" font="1">sure to grow a desire of an entirely opposite nature−−a desire directly</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">opposed to the one you are starving to death. Picture the opposite desire,</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="443" height="14" font="1">and think of it often. Let your mind dwell upon it lovingly and let the</text>
<text top="735" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">imagination help to build it up into form. Think of the advantages that will</text>

<text top="159" left="72" width="447" height="14" font="1">possess this power. Then you must be ready for the next step which is</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="229" height="14" font="1">&quot;Faith&quot; or &quot;Confident Expectation.&quot;</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">Now, faith or confident expectation is not made to order in most persons,</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">and in such cases one must acquire it gradually. Many of you who read</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">these lines will have an understanding of the subject that will give you this</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">faith. But to those who lack it, we suggest that they practice on some trivial</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">phases of the mental make−up, some petty trait of character, in which the</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">victory will be easy and simple. From this stage they should work up to</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="410" height="14" font="1">more difficult tasks, until at last they gain that faith or confident</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="319" height="14" font="1">expectation that comes from persevering practice.</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">The greater the degree of faith or confident expectation that one carries</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">with him in this task of character building, the greater will be his success.</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">And this because of well established psychological laws. Faith or confident</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">expectation clears away the mental path and renders the work easier, while</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">doubt or lack of faith retards the work, and acts as obstacles and stumbling</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">blocks. Strong Desire, and Faith, or confident expectation are the first two</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="199" height="14" font="1">steps. The third is Will−power.</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="303" height="14" font="1">By Will−power we do not mean that strenuous,</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">clenching−of−fist−and−frowning−brow thing that many think of when they</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">say &quot;Will.&quot; Will is not manifested in this way. The true Will is called into</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="445" height="14" font="1">play by one realizing the &quot;I&quot; part of himself and speaking the word of</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">command from that center of power and strength. It is the voice of the &quot;I.&quot;</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="326" height="14" font="1">And it is needed in this work of character building.</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">So now you are ready for work, being possessed of (1) Strong Desire; (2)</text>

<text top="63" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">Then comes the actual work. The first thing to do is to lay the track for a</text>
<text top="82" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">new Character Habit. &quot;Habit?&quot; you may ask in surprise. Yes, Habit! For</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">that word gives the secret of the whole thing. Our characters are made up of</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">inherited or acquired habits. Think over this a little and you will see the</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="444" height="14" font="1">truth of it. You do certain things without a thought, because you have</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">gotten into the habit of doing them. You act in certain ways because you</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">have established the habit. You are in the habit of being truthful, honest,</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">virtuous, because you have established the habit of being so. Do you doubt</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">this? Then look around you−−or look within your own heart, and you will</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">see that you have lost some of your old habits of action, and have acquired</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">new ones. The building up of Character is the building up of Habits. And</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">the changing of Character is the changing of Habits. It will be well for you</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">to settle this fact in your own mind, for it will give you the secret of many</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="217" height="14" font="1">things connected with the subject.</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="410" height="14" font="1">And, remember this, that Habit is almost entirely a matter of the</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">sub−conscious mentality. It is true that Habits originate in the conscious</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="450" height="14" font="1">mind, but as they are established they sink down into the depths of the</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">sub−conscious mentality, and thereafter become &quot;second nature,&quot; which, by</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">the way, is often more powerful than the original nature of the person. The</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">Duke of Wellington said that habit was as strong as ten natures, and he</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">proceeded to drill habits into his army until they found it natural to act in</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="456" height="14" font="1">accordance with the habits pounded into them during the drills. Darwin</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="448" height="14" font="1">relates an interesting instance of the force of habit over the reason. He</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">found that his habit of starting back at the sudden approach of danger was</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">so firmly established that no will−power could enable him to keep his face</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">pressed up against the cage of the cobra in the Zoological Gardens when</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">the snake struck at him, although he knew the glass was so thick that there</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">could be no danger, and although he exerted the full force of his will. But</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="456" height="14" font="1">we venture to say that one could overcome even this strongly ingrained</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">habit, by gradually training the sub−conscious mentality and establishing a</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="207" height="14" font="1">new habit of thought and action.</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">It is not only during the actual process of &quot;willing&quot; the new habit that the</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">work of making the new mental path goes on. In fact, the Yogis believe that</text>
<text top="735" left="72" width="432" height="14" font="1">the principal part of the work goes on sub−consciously between the</text>

<text top="82" left="72" width="451" height="14" font="1">the real work of solving the problem is performed sub−consciously, as</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">related in our last lesson. As an example, we may call your attention to</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">some instances of the cultivation of physical habits. A physical task learned</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">in the evening is much easier to perform the following−morning than it was</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">the night before, and still easier the following Monday morning than it was</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">on the Saturday afternoon previous. The Germans have a saying that &quot;we</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="426" height="14" font="1">learn to skate in summer, and to swim in winter,&quot; meaning that the</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">impression passed on to the subconscious mentality deepens and broadens</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="427" height="14" font="1">during the interval of rest. The best plan is to make frequent, sharp</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">impressions, and then to allow reasonable periods of rest in order to give</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">the sub−conscious mentality the opportunity to do its work. By &quot;sharp&quot;</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">impressions we mean impressions given under _strong attention_, as we</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="381" height="14" font="1">have mentioned in some of the earlier lessons of this series.</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="436" height="14" font="1">A writer has well said: &quot;Sow an act, reap a habit; sow a habit, reap a</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">character; sow a character, reap a destiny,&quot; thus recognizing habit as the</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">source of character. We recognize this truth in our training of children,</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">forming goods habits of character by constant repetition, by watchfulness,</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">etc. Habit acts as a<i> motive</i> when established, so that while we think we are</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">acting without motive we may be acting under the strong motive power of</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">some well established habit. Herbert Spencer has well said: &quot;The habitually</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">honest man does what is right, not consciously because he 'ought' but with</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">simple satisfaction; and is ill at ease till it is done.&quot; Some may object that</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">this idea of Habit as a basis of Character may do away with the idea of a</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="487" height="14" font="1">developed moral conscientiousness, as for instance, Josiah Royce who says:</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">&quot;The establishment of organized habit is never in itself enough to ensure</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="447" height="14" font="1">the growth of an enlightened moral conscientiousness&quot; but to such we</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">would say that one must &quot;want to&quot; cultivate a high character before he will</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="448" height="14" font="1">create the habits usual to the same, and the &quot;want to&quot; is the sign of the</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">&quot;moral conscientiousness,&quot; rather than the habit. And the same is true of the</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">&quot;ought to&quot; side of the subject. The &quot;ought to&quot; arises in the conscious mind</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">in the beginning, and inspires the cultivation of the habit, although the latter</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">after a while becomes automatic, a matter of the sub−conscious mentality,</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">without any &quot;ought to&quot; attachment. It then becomes a matter of &quot;like to.&quot;</text>

<text top="63" left="72" width="443" height="14" font="1">Thus we see that the moulding, modifying, changing, and building of</text>
<text top="82" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">Character is largely a matter of the establishing of Habits. And what is the</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">best way to establish Habits? becomes our next question. The answer of the</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">Yogi is: &quot;Establish a Mental Image, and then build your Habit around it.&quot;</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="354" height="14" font="1">And in that sentence he has condensed a whole system.</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">Everything we see having a form is built around a mental image−−either</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">the mental image of some man, some animal, or of the Absolute. This is the</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">rule of the universe, and in the matter of character−building we but follow a</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="451" height="14" font="1">well established rule. When we wish to build a house, we first think of</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="442" height="14" font="1">&quot;house&quot; in a general way. Then we begin to think of &quot;what kind&quot; of a</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">house. Then we go into details. Then we consult an architect, and he makes</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">us a plan, which plan is his mental image, suggested by our mental image.</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">Then, the plan once decided upon, we consult the builder, and at last the</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">house stands completed−−an objectified Mental Image. And so it is with</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="374" height="14" font="1">every created thing−−all manifestation of a Mental Image.</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">And so, when we wish to establish a trait of Character, we must form a</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">clear, distinct Mental Image of what we wish to be. This is an important</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">step. Make your picture clear and distinct, and fasten it in your mind. Then</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">begin to build around it. Let your thoughts dwell upon the mental picture.</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="452" height="14" font="1">Let your imagination see yourself as possessed of the desired trait, and</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="3"><i>acting it out</i>. Act it out in your imagination, over and over again, as often as</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">possible, persevering, and continuously, seeing yourself manifesting the</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">trait under a variety of circumstances and conditions. As you continue to do</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">this you will find that you will gradually begin to express the thought in</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">action−−to objectify the subjective mental image. It will become &quot;natural&quot;</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">for you to act more and more in accordance with your mental image, until</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="438" height="14" font="1">at last the new habit will become firmly fixed in your mind, and will</text>

<text top="178" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">following this method of character−building. The great trouble with the</text>

<text top="217" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">They have thought that they were doomed to remain just the creatures that</text>

<text top="255" left="72" width="439" height="14" font="1">was not ended, and that they had within themselves a creative power</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">adapted to the needs of their case. When man first realizes this truth, and</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">proves it by practice, he becomes another being. He finds himself superior</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">to environment, and training−−he finds that he may ride over these things.</text>

<text top="217" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">that you are the Equal of any and every man. You come from the same</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="450" height="14" font="1">source. You are an expression of the same One Life. In the eyes of the</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">Absolute you are the equal of any man, even the highest in the land. Truth</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">is &quot;Things as God sees them&quot;−−and in Truth you and the man are equal,</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">and, at the last, One. All feelings of Inferiority are illusions, errors, and lies,</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">and have no existence in Truth. When in the company of others remember</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="447" height="14" font="1">this fact and realize that the Life Principle in you is talking to the Life</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">Principle in them. Let the Life Principle flow through you, and endeavor to</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">forget your personal self. At the same time, endeavor to see that same Life</text>

<text top="466" left="72" width="456" height="14" font="1">of Courage, and the other will likewise feel it. You have within you the</text>

<text top="505" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">Fear−−Fearlessness is your Divine Heritage, avail yourself of it. You have</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="410" height="14" font="1">Self−Conscience, for the Self is the &quot;I&quot; within you, not the petty</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="440" height="14" font="1">personality, and you must have confidence in that &quot;I.&quot; Retreat within</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">yourself until you feel the presence of the &quot;I,&quot; and then will you have a</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">Self−Confidence that nothing can shake or disturb. Once having attained</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">the permanent consciousness of the &quot;I,&quot; you will have poise. Once having</text>

<text top="63" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">WORD IMAGES. It is difficult for the mind to build itself around an idea,</text>
<text top="82" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">unless that idea be expressed in words. A word is the center of an idea, just</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="449" height="14" font="1">as the idea is the center of the mental image, and the mental image the</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">center of the growing mental habit. Therefore, the Yogis always lay great</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="487" height="14" font="1">stress upon the use of words in this way. In the particular case before us, we</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">should suggest the holding before you of a few words crystallizing the main</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="441" height="14" font="1">thought. We suggest the words &quot;I Am&quot;; Courage; Confidence; Poise;</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">Firmness; Equality. Commit these words to memory, and then endeavor to</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">fix in your mind a clear conception of the meaning of each word, so that</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">each may stand for a Live Idea when you say it. Beware of parrot−like or</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">phonographic repetition. Let each word's meaning stand out clearly before</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">you, so that when you repeat it you may<i> feel</i> its meaning. Repeat the words</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">over frequently, when opportunity presents itself, and you will soon begin</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="442" height="14" font="1">to notice that they act as a strong mental tonic upon you, producing a</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="407" height="14" font="1">bracing, energizing effect. And each time you repeat the words,</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">understandingly, you have done something to clear away the mental path</text>

<text top="466" left="72" width="443" height="14" font="1">indicated by the words named. Picture yourself under the most trying</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">circumstances, making use of the desired qualities, and manifesting them</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="431" height="14" font="1">fully. Endeavor to picture yourself as acting out your part well, and</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="450" height="14" font="1">exhibiting the desired qualities. Do not be ashamed to indulge in these</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">day−dreams, for they are the prophecies of the things to follow, and you are</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">but rehearsing your part before the day of the performance. Practice makes</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="420" height="14" font="1">perfect, and if you accustom yourself to acting in a certain way in</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">imagination, you will find it much easier to play your part when the real</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">performance occurs. This may seem childish to many of you, but if you</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">have an actor among your acquaintances, consult him about it, and you will</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">find that he will heartily recommend it. He will tell you what practice does</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">for one in this direction, and how repeated practice and rehearsals may fix a</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">character so firmly in a man's mind that he may find it difficult to divest</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="443" height="14" font="1">himself of it after a time. Choose well the part you wish to play−−the</text>

<text top="313" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">changed person. Let your thought express itself in action, whenever you get</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">a good chance. But do not try to force chances just to try your strength. Do</text>

<text top="507" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">writers and students during the past twenty years, but which has also been</text>
<text top="526" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">misunderstood, and, alas, too often misused, by some of those who have</text>
<text top="545" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">been attracted to the subject. We allude to what has been called the &quot;Power</text>
<text top="564" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">of Thought.&quot; While this power is very real, and like any other of the forces</text>
<text top="583" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">of nature may be properly used and applied in our every day life, still many</text>
<text top="603" left="72" width="452" height="14" font="1">students of the power of the Mind have misused it and have stooped to</text>
<text top="622" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">practices worthy only of the followers of the schools of &quot;Black Magic.&quot; We</text>
<text top="641" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">hear on all sides of the use of &quot;treatments&quot; for selfish and often base ends,</text>
<text top="660" left="72" width="448" height="14" font="1">those following these practices seeming to be in utter ignorance of the</text>
<text top="679" left="72" width="448" height="14" font="1">occult laws brought into operation, and the terrible reaction inevitably</text>
<text top="699" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">falling to the lot of those practicing this negative form of mental influence.</text>
<text top="718" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">We have been amazed at the prevailing ignorance concerning the nature</text>
<text top="737" left="72" width="487" height="14" font="1">and effects of this improper use of mental force, and at the same time, at the</text>

<text top="63" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">common custom of such selfish, improper uses. This, more particularly,</text>
<text top="82" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">when the true occultist knows that these things are not necessary, even to</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">those who seek &quot;Success&quot; by mental forces. There is a true method of the</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">use of mental forces, as well as an improper use, and we trust that in this</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">lesson we may be able to bring the matter sharply and clearly before the</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="142" height="14" font="1">minds of our students.</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">In our first course (The Fourteen Lessons) in the several lessons entitled,</text>

<text top="255" left="72" width="433" height="14" font="1">other minds, and many other writers have called the attention of the</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">Western world to the same facts. There has been a general awakening of</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">interest in this phase of the subject among the Western people of late years,</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">and many and wonderful are the theories that have been advanced among</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="444" height="14" font="1">the conflicting schools regarding the matter. But, notwithstanding the</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">conflicting theories, there is a general agreement upon the fundamental</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">facts. They all agree that the mental forces may be used to affect oneself</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">and others, and many have started in to use these mental forces for their</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">own selfish ends and purposes, believing that they were fully justified in so</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">doing, and being unaware of the web of psychic causes and effects which</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="323" height="14" font="1">they were weaving around them by their practices.</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">Now, at the beginning, let us impress upon the minds of our students the</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">fact that while it is undoubtedly true that people who are unaware of the</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="452" height="14" font="1">true sources of strength within them, may be, and often are affected by</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="427" height="14" font="1">mental force exerted by others, it is equally true that no one can be</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">adversely affected in this way providing he realizes the &quot;I&quot; within himself,</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">which is the only Real part of him, and which is an impregnable tower of</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">strength against the assaults of others. There is no cause for all of this fear</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">that is being manifested by many Western students of thought−power, who</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">are in constant dread of being &quot;treated&quot; adversely by other people. The man</text>

<text top="716" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">this−−the habitual recognition of the &quot;I,&quot; and a few moments' meditation</text>

<text top="159" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">This realization of the &quot;I,&quot; which we brought out in the first few lessons of</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">the present series, is the best and only real method of self−protection. This</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">may be easily understood, when we remind you that the whole phenomena</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="445" height="14" font="1">of mental influencing belongs to the &quot;illusion&quot; side of existence−−the</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">negative side−−and that the Real and Positive side must of necessity be</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">stronger. Nothing can affect the Real in you−−and the nearer you get to the</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">Real, in realization and understanding, the stronger do you become.<i> This is</i></text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="200" height="14" font="3"><i>the whole secret</i>. Think it over.</text>

<text top="370" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">growing. To such, we would say &quot;Creep as close the Realization of the I, as</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">possible, and rest your spiritual feet firmly upon the rock of the Real Self.&quot;</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">If you feel that people, circumstances, or things are influencing you unduly,</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">stand up boldly, and deny the influence. Say something like this, &quot;I DENY</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">the power or influence of persons, circumstances, or things to adversely</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">affect me. I ASSERT my Reality, Power and Dominion over these things.&quot;</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="400" height="14" font="1">These words may seem very simple, but when uttered with the</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="448" height="14" font="1">consciousness of the Truth underlying them, they become as a mighty</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">force. You will understand, of course, that there is no magic or virtue in the</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="487" height="14" font="1">words themselves−−that is, in the grouping of the letters forming the words,</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="451" height="14" font="1">or the sounds of the words−−the virtue resting in the<i> idea</i> of which the</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="429" height="14" font="1">words are the expression. You will be surprised at the effect of this</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">STATEMENT upon depressing, or adverse influences surrounding you. If</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">you−−<i>you</i> who are reading these words now−−feel yourself subject to any</text>

<text top="677" left="72" width="452" height="14" font="1">and repeat these words firmly, and with faith, you will feel the adverse</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">influences disappearing. You will almost see the clouds falling back from</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">you. Try it now, before reading further, and you will become conscious of a</text>

<text top="274" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">your Recognition and Faith, will be the power at your disposal. Faith and</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">Recognition renders man a god. If we could but fully recognize and realize</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="458" height="14" font="1">just what we are, we could rise above this entire plane of negative, dark</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">world of thought. But we have become so blinded and stupefied with the</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">race−thought of fear and weakness, and so hypnotized with the suggestions</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">of weakness that we hear on all sides of us, that even the best of us find it</text>

<text top="409" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">and discouragement. But, let us remember this, brothers and sisters, that</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">these periods of &quot;back−sliding&quot; become less frequent, and last a shorter</text>

<text top="524" left="72" width="447" height="14" font="1">needed by many who read these lessons. There has been so much said</text>

<text top="562" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">should be taught that it is in their power to rise above this thing−− that the</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="289" height="14" font="1">weapon for its defeat is already in their hand.</text>

<text top="82" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">far as our personal thought world is concerned. There is a wonderful occult</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">truth in the last sentence. We are the makers, preservers, and destroyers of</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">our personal thought−world. We may bring into it that which we desire to</text>

<text top="236" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">popular religious conceptions picture the One Being as a Trinity, composed</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="385" height="14" font="1">of Brahma, the Creator; Vishnu, the Preserver, and Siva, the</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="432" height="14" font="1">Destroyer−−not three gods, as is commonly supposed, but a Trinity</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">composed of three aspects of Deity or Being. This idea of the threefold</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">Being is also applicable to the Individual−−&quot;as above so below.&quot; The &quot;I&quot; is</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">the Being of the Individual, and the thought−world is its manifestation. It</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">creates, preserves, and destroys−−as it Will. Carry this idea with you, and</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="402" height="14" font="1">realize that your individual thought−world is your own field of</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="382" height="14" font="1">manifestation. In it you are constantly creating−−constantly</text>

<text top="466" left="72" width="445" height="14" font="1">you bring it into active being, so far as you are concerned. And if you</text>

<text top="159" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">consequently living on both planes, partly in each, the consequence being</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">that there is a struggle between the conflicting laws of the two planes. The</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">present stage is one of the hardest on the Path of Attainment, and resembles</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">the birth−pains of the physical body. But you are being born into a higher</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">plane, and the pain after becoming the most acute will begin to ease, and in</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">the end will disappear, and then will come peace and calm. When the pain</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">becomes the most acute, then be cheered with the certainty that you have</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">reached the crisis of your new spiritual birth, and that you will soon gain</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">peace. And then you will see that the peace and bliss will be worth all the</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">pain and struggle. Be brave, fellow followers of The Path−−Deliverance is</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">nigh. Soon will come the Silence that follows the Storm. The pain that you</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="447" height="14" font="1">are experiencing−−ah, well do we know that you are experiencing the</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">pain−−is not punishment, but is a necessary part of your growth. All Life</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="406" height="14" font="1">follows this plan−−the pains of labor and birth ever precede the</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">Deliverance. Such is Life−−and Life is based upon Truth−−and all is well</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="487" height="14" font="1">with the world. We did not intend to speak of these things in this lesson, but</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="407" height="14" font="1">as we write there comes to us a great cry for help and a word of</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">encouragement and hope, from the Class which is taking this course of</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="449" height="14" font="1">lessons, and we feel bound to respond as we have done. Peace be with</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="116" height="14" font="1">you−−one and all.</text>

<text top="581" left="72" width="255" height="14" font="1">have called &quot;Sub−conscious Influence.&quot;</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">All students of the Occult are aware of the fact that men may be, and are,</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">largely influenced by the thoughts of others. Not only is this the case in</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">instances where thoughts are directed from the mind of one person to the</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">mind of another, but also when there is no special direction or intention in</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="435" height="14" font="1">the thought sent forth. The vibrations of thoughts linger in the astral</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">atmosphere long after the effort that sent forth the thought has passed. The</text>
<text top="735" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">astral atmosphere is charged with the vibrations of thinkers of many years</text>

<text top="82" left="72" width="423" height="14" font="1">ready to receive them at this time. And we all attract to us thought</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">vibrations corresponding in nature with those which we are in the habit of</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">entertaining. The Law of Attraction is in full operation, and one who makes</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="365" height="14" font="1">a study of the subject may see instances of it on all sides.</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="429" height="14" font="1">We invite to ourselves these thought vibrations by maintaining and</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">entertaining thoughts along certain lines. If we cultivate a habit of thinking</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">along the lines of Cheerfulness, Brightness and Optimism, we attract to</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">ourselves similar thought vibrations of others and we will find that before</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">long we will find all sorts of cheerful thoughts pouring into our minds from</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">all directions. And, likewise, if we harbor thoughts of Gloom, Despair,</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="468" height="14" font="1">Pessimism, we lay ourselves open to the influx of similar thoughts which</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="447" height="14" font="1">have emanated from the minds of others. Thoughts of Anger, Hate, or</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">Jealousy attract similar thoughts which serve to feed the flame and keep</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="449" height="14" font="1">alive the fire of these low emotions. Thoughts of Love tend to draw to</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">ourselves the loving thoughts of others which tend to fill us with a glow of</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="101" height="14" font="1">loving emotion.</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="452" height="14" font="1">And not only are we affected in this way by the thoughts of others, but</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">what is known as &quot;Suggestion&quot; also plays an important part in this matter of</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="421" height="14" font="1">sub−conscious influence. We find that the mind has a tendency to</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">reproduce the emotions, moods, shades of thought, and feelings of other</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">persons, as evidenced by their attitude, appearance, facial expression, or</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">words. If we associate with persons of a gloomy temperament, we run the</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">risk of &quot;catching&quot; their mental trouble by the law of suggestion, unless we</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="428" height="14" font="1">understand this law and counteract it. In the same way we find that</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="446" height="14" font="1">cheerfulness is contagious, and if we keep in the company of cheerful</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="440" height="14" font="1">people we are very apt to take on their mental quality. The same rule</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">applies to frequenting the company of unsuccessful or successful people, as</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">the case may be. If we allow ourselves to take up the suggestions constantly</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="472" height="14" font="1">emanating from them, we will find that our minds will begin to reproduce</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="444" height="14" font="1">the tones, attitudes, characteristics, dispositions and traits of the other</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">persons, and before long we will be living on the same mental plane. As we</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">have repeatedly said, these things are true only when we allow ourselves to</text>
<text top="735" left="72" width="418" height="14" font="1">&quot;take on&quot; the impressions, but unless one has mastered the law of</text>

<text top="82" left="72" width="487" height="14" font="1">apt to be affected by it. All of you readily recall the effect of certain persons</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">upon others with whom they come in contact. One has a faculty of inspiring</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">with vigor and energy those in whose company he happens to be. Another</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">depresses those around him, and is avoided as a &quot;human wet−blanket.&quot;</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="471" height="14" font="1">Another will cause a feeling of uneasiness in those around him, by reason</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">of his prevailing attitude of distrust, suspicion, and low cunning. Some</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="434" height="14" font="1">carry an atmosphere of health around them, while others seem to be</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="424" height="14" font="1">surrounded with a sickly aura of disease, even when their physical</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">condition does not seem to indicate the lack of health. Mental states have a</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">subtle way of impressing themselves upon us, and the student who will take</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">the trouble to closely observe those with whom he comes in contact will</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="283" height="14" font="1">receive a liberal education along these lines.</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">There is of course a great difference in the degree of suggestibility among</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">different persons. There are those who are almost immune, while at the</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="443" height="14" font="1">other end of the line are to be found others who are so constantly and</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">strongly impressed by the suggestions of others, conscious or unconscious,</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">that they may be said to scarcely have any independent thought or will of</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="442" height="14" font="1">their own. But nearly all persons are suggestible to a greater or lesser</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="47" height="14" font="1">degree.</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">It must not be supposed from what we have said that all suggestions are</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">&quot;bad,&quot; harmful, or undesirable. Many suggestions are very good for us, and</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="482" height="14" font="1">coming at the right time have aided us much. But, nevertheless, it is well to</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">always<i> let your own mind pass upon</i> these suggestions, before allowing</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">them to manifest in your sub−conscious mind. Let the final decision be</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="416" height="14" font="1">your own−−and not the will of another−−although you may have</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="394" height="14" font="1">considered outside suggestions in connection with the matter.</text>
<text top="639" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">Remember always that YOU are an Individual, having a mind and Will of</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">your own. Rest firmly upon the base of your &quot;I&quot; consciousness, and you</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">will find yourself able to manifest a wonderful strength against the adverse</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">suggestions of others. Be your own Suggestor−−train and influence your</text>

<text top="735" left="72" width="373" height="14" font="1">the suggestions of others. Grow the sense of Individuality.</text>

<text top="63" left="72" width="423" height="14" font="1">There has been much written of recent years in the Western world</text>
<text top="82" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">regarding the effect of the Mental Attitude upon Success and attainment</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="448" height="14" font="1">upon the material plane. While much of this is nothing but the wildest</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="451" height="14" font="1">imagining, still there remains a very firm and solid substratum of truth</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="106" height="14" font="1">underlying it all.</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="454" height="14" font="1">It is undoubtedly true that one's prevailing mental attitude is constantly</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="440" height="14" font="1">manifesting and objectifying itself in his life. Things, circumstances,</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="451" height="14" font="1">people, plans, all seem to fit into the general ideal of the strong mental</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="436" height="14" font="1">attitude of a man. And this from the operation of mental law along a</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="165" height="14" font="1">number of lines of action.</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">In the first place, the mind when directed toward a certain set of objects</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">becomes very alert to discover things concerning those objects−−to seize</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">upon things, opportunities, persons, ideas, and facts tending to promote the</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="440" height="14" font="1">objects thought of. The man who is looking for facts to prove certain</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">theories, invariably finds them, and is also quite likely to overlook facts</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="451" height="14" font="1">tending to disprove his theory. The Optimist and the Pessimist passing</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="462" height="14" font="1">along the same streets, each sees thousands of examples tending to fit in</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">with his idea. As Kay says: &quot;When one is engaged in seeking for a thing, if</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="459" height="14" font="1">he keep the image of it clearly before the mind, he will be very likely to</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">find it, and that too, probably, where it would otherwise have escaped his</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">notice. So when one is engaged in thinking on a subject, thoughts of things</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="461" height="14" font="1">resembling it, or bearing upon it, and tending to illustrate it, come up on</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">every side. Truly, we may well say of the mind, as has been said of the eye,</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">that 'it perceives only what it brings within the power of perceiving.'&quot; John</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">Burroughs has well said regarding this that &quot;No one ever found the walking</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">fern who did not have the walking fern in his mind. A person whose eye is</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">full of Indian relics picks them up in every field he walks through. They are</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">quickly recognized because the eye has been commissioned to find them.&quot;</text>
<text top="658" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">When the mind is kept firmly fixed upon some ideal or aim, its whole and</text>
<text top="677" left="72" width="452" height="14" font="1">varied powers are bent toward the realization and manifestation of that</text>
<text top="697" left="72" width="485" height="14" font="1">ideal. In thousands of ways the mind will operate to objectify the subjective</text>
<text top="716" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">mental attitude, a great proportion of the mental effort being accomplished</text>
<text top="735" left="72" width="446" height="14" font="1">along sub−conscious lines. It is of the greatest importance to one who</text>

<text top="63" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">wishes to succeed in any undertaking, to keep before his mind's eye a clear</text>
<text top="82" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">mental image of that which he desires. He should picture the thing desired,</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="480" height="14" font="1">and himself as securing it, until it becomes almost real. In this way he calls</text>
<text top="121" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">to his aid his entire mental force and power, along the sub−conscious lines,</text>
<text top="140" left="72" width="397" height="14" font="1">and, as it were, makes a clear path over which he may walk to</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="406" height="14" font="1">accomplishment. Bain says regarding this: &quot;By aiming at a new</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="476" height="14" font="1">construction, we must clearly conceive what is aimed at. Where we have a</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="438" height="14" font="1">very distinct and intelligible model before us, we are in a fair way to</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="447" height="14" font="1">succeed; in proportion as the ideal is dim and wavering, we stagger or</text>
<text top="236" left="72" width="452" height="14" font="1">miscarry.&quot; Maudsley says: &quot;We cannot do an act voluntarily unless we</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">know what we are going to do, and we cannot know exactly what we are</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">going to do until we have taught ourselves to do it.&quot; Carpenter says: &quot;The</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">continued concentration of attention upon a certain idea gives it a dominant</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">power, not only over the mind, but over the body.&quot; Muller says: &quot;The idea</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="451" height="14" font="1">of our own strength gives strength to our movements. A person who is</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">confident of effecting anything by muscular efforts will do it more easily</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="452" height="14" font="1">than one not so confident of his own power.&quot; Tanner says: &quot;To believe</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">firmly is almost tantamount in the end to accomplishment. Extraordinary</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="435" height="14" font="1">instances are related showing the influence of the will over even the</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="140" height="14" font="1">involuntary muscles.&quot;</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="477" height="14" font="1">Along the same lines, many Western writers have added their testimony to</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="451" height="14" font="1">the Yogi principle of the manifestation of thought into action. Kay has</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="474" height="14" font="1">written: &quot;A clear and accurate idea of what we wish to do, and how it is to</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="487" height="14" font="1">be effected, is of the utmost value and importance in all the affairs of life. A</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="486" height="14" font="1">man's conduct naturally shapes itself according to the ideas in his mind, and</text>
<text top="562" left="72" width="456" height="14" font="1">nothing contributes more to success in life than having a high ideal and</text>
<text top="581" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">keeping it constantly in view. Where such is the case one can hardly fail in</text>
<text top="601" left="72" width="479" height="14" font="1">attaining it. Numerous unexpected circumstances will be found to conspire</text>
<text top="620" left="72" width="433" height="14" font="1">to bring it about, and even what seemed at first to be hostile may be</text>

<text top="82" left="72" width="429" height="14" font="1">to see how the space clears around a man and leaves him room and</text>
<text top="101" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">freedom.&quot; Simpson has said: &quot;A passionate desire and an unwearied will</text>

<text top="140" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">feeble.&quot; And Maudsley gives to aspiring youth a great truth, when he says:</text>
<text top="159" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">&quot;Thus it is that aspirations are often prophecies, the harbingers of what a</text>
<text top="178" left="72" width="426" height="14" font="1">man shall be in a condition to perform.&quot; And we may conclude the</text>
<text top="197" left="72" width="483" height="14" font="1">paragraph by quoting Lytton: &quot;Dream, O youth, dream manfully and nobly,</text>
<text top="217" left="72" width="221" height="14" font="1">and thy dreams shall be prophets.&quot;</text>
<text top="255" left="72" width="484" height="14" font="1">This principle of the power of the Mental Image is strongly impressed upon</text>
<text top="274" left="72" width="460" height="14" font="1">the mind of the _chela_, or student, by the Yogi teachers. The student is</text>
<text top="293" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">taught that just as the house is erected in accordance with the plan of the</text>
<text top="313" left="72" width="453" height="14" font="1">architect, so is one's life built in accordance with the prevailing Mental</text>
<text top="332" left="72" width="449" height="14" font="1">Image. The mind sub−consciously moulds itself around the prevailing</text>
<text top="351" left="72" width="470" height="14" font="1">mental image or attitude, and then proceeds to draw upon the outer world</text>
<text top="370" left="72" width="463" height="14" font="1">for material with which to build in accordance with the plan. Not only is</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="478" height="14" font="1">one's character built in this way, but the circumstances and incidents of his</text>
<text top="409" left="72" width="475" height="14" font="1">life follow the same rule. The Yogi student is instructed into the mysteries</text>
<text top="428" left="72" width="481" height="14" font="1">of the power of the mind in this direction, not that he may make use of it to</text>
<text top="447" left="72" width="446" height="14" font="1">build up material success, or to realize his personal desires−−for he is</text>
<text top="466" left="72" width="469" height="14" font="1">taught to avoid these things−−but he is fully instructed, nevertheless, that</text>
<text top="485" left="72" width="455" height="14" font="1">he may understand the workings of the law around him. And it is a fact</text>
<text top="505" left="72" width="473" height="14" font="1">well known to close students of the occult, that the few who have attained</text>
<text top="524" left="72" width="457" height="14" font="1">extraordinarily high degrees of development, make use of this power in</text>
<text top="543" left="72" width="464" height="14" font="1">order to help the race. Many a world movement has been directed by the</text>

<text top="601" left="72" width="466" height="14" font="1">concentrating upon it in meditation, actually hastened the progress of the</text>

<text top="236" left="72" width="465" height="14" font="1">dropped off like an old worn out husk. Old conventions, ideals, customs,</text>

<text top="370" left="72" width="467" height="14" font="1">the remedy. Many false cases of diagnosis and prescription are even now</text>
<text top="389" left="72" width="451" height="14" font="1">noticeable, and will become still more in evidence as the years roll by.</text>
