<text top="373" left="90" width="435" height="9" font="2">might be surprised by the obvious bhaktic melody throughout this little book. It is also obvious that </text>
<text top="385" left="90" width="427" height="9" font="2">this is the autobiography of Maharaj’s awakening, not his early teaching. It is a love song both to </text>

<text top="442" left="90" width="414" height="9" font="2">I have no idea of what Maharaj was like before he met his teacher. Perhaps he was rude and </text>

<text top="477" left="90" width="408" height="9" font="2">(priests, rabbis, sheiks, sifu, etc.), or did he just have a raggedy personality which returned? </text>

<text top="546" left="90" width="412" height="9" font="2">personality is not important in a teaching sense, although this issue may be very important to </text>

<text top="638" left="90" width="416" height="9" font="2">The chanting libretto contained the teachings. he would repeat certain phrases over and over. </text>
<text top="649" left="90" width="411" height="9" font="2">The Bhakta is extremely important for most of us. Zen monks were incredibly fixated on their </text>
