<text top="137" left="45" width="275" height="13" font="15">The third of February 1936, early morning, saw my horse-</text>
<text top="153" left="21" width="299" height="13" font="15">cart rolling on the uneven two-and-a-half-mile road from</text>
<text top="168" left="21" width="299" height="13" font="15">Tiruvannamalai railway station to Ramanashram. Two sleepless</text>
<text top="184" left="21" width="299" height="13" font="15">nights in the train from Bombay found me tired in body and</text>
<text top="199" left="21" width="299" height="13" font="15">mind. My head was swimming and my senses were confused.</text>
<text top="215" left="21" width="299" height="13" font="15">I had hoped for some rest in the Ashram, but when I arrived</text>
<text top="231" left="21" width="299" height="13" font="15">there at last, there was not a soul to be seen anywhere. Presently,</text>
<text top="246" left="21" width="299" height="13" font="15">a corpulent man with a giant rugged head and scarlet-red lips</text>
<text top="262" left="21" width="299" height="13" font="15">from perpetual chewing of betel-nuts appeared. He was, I later</text>
<text top="277" left="21" width="299" height="13" font="15">discovered, “the legal adviser” of the Ashram, who sometimes</text>
<text top="293" left="21" width="299" height="13" font="15">acted as the <i>de facto sarvadhikari</i> (manager) as well. “Is that</text>
<text top="309" left="21" width="299" height="13" font="15">Mr. Cohen? Follow me quickly before the Maharshi goes out</text>
<text top="324" left="21" width="299" height="13" font="15">for his walk,” he called out. I obeyed, extremely eager to see</text>
<text top="340" left="21" width="299" height="13" font="15">the great Sage, who had haunted me night and day for three</text>
<text top="355" left="21" width="299" height="13" font="15">long months. I was led to a small dining room, at the door of</text>
<text top="371" left="21" width="299" height="13" font="15">which I was asked to remove my shoes. As I was trying to</text>
<text top="387" left="21" width="299" height="13" font="15">unlace them, my eyes fell on a pleasant-looking middle-aged</text>
<text top="402" left="21" width="299" height="13" font="15">man inside the room, wearing nothing but a <i>kaupin</i>, with eyes</text>
<text top="418" left="21" width="299" height="13" font="15">as cool as moonbeams, sitting on the floor before a leaf-plate</text>
<text top="433" left="21" width="299" height="13" font="15">nearly emptied, and beckoning me with the gentlest of nods</text>
<text top="449" left="21" width="168" height="13" font="15">and the sweetest smile imaginable.</text>
<text top="465" left="45" width="275" height="13" font="15">He was the Maharshi himself. My mind, which was already</text>
<text top="480" left="21" width="299" height="13" font="15">in a state of haze, grew now more confused in my haste to</text>
<text top="496" left="21" width="299" height="13" font="15">enter. But the shoe lace resisted. So I tugged at and broke it.</text>
<text top="511" left="21" width="299" height="13" font="15">Just then my guide appeared again and said: “If you have any</text>

<text top="540" left="168" width="6" height="11" font="20">4</text>
<text top="29" left="21" width="299" height="13" font="15">fruits to offer, bring them now.” “They are in my suit case,” I</text>
<text top="45" left="21" width="299" height="13" font="15">replied, and plunged my hands into my pockets for the keys.</text>
<text top="61" left="21" width="299" height="13" font="15">But the keys had gone: I had dropped them in the train or at</text>
<text top="76" left="21" width="299" height="13" font="15">the station, I did not know where, in my hurry to race to the</text>
<text top="92" left="21" width="299" height="13" font="15">Ashram. I told this to the legal adviser and immediately forgot</text>
<text top="107" left="21" width="184" height="13" font="15">all about them and entered the room.</text>
<text top="126" left="21" width="299" height="13" font="15">It was then the Ashram’s custom to honour the newcomer by</text>
<text top="142" left="44" width="276" height="13" font="15">giving him his first meal in a line directly opposite the</text>
<text top="158" left="44" width="276" height="13" font="15">Maharshi’s seat and at hardly four feet distance from it. My</text>
<text top="175" left="44" width="276" height="13" font="15">leaf-plate was thus placed there with two rice cakes on it. I</text>
<text top="191" left="44" width="276" height="13" font="15">took no notice of the cakes, although my hand fingered</text>
<text top="207" left="44" width="276" height="13" font="15">them, but directed my whole look at the peaceful</text>
<text top="223" left="44" width="276" height="13" font="15">countenance of Sri Bhagavan. He had by then finished eating</text>
<text top="239" left="44" width="276" height="13" font="15">and was slowly rolling a betel-leaf for a chew, as if deliberately</text>
<text top="255" left="44" width="276" height="13" font="15">to give me a little more of his company, when a man entered</text>
<text top="271" left="44" width="276" height="13" font="15">from the back door, which was the passage to the small</text>
<text top="287" left="44" width="276" height="13" font="15">kitchen, and, in a low voice, said something in Tamil to</text>
<text top="303" left="44" width="276" height="13" font="15">him, from which I understood the single word “keys.” Then</text>
<text top="319" left="44" width="276" height="13" font="15">Maharshi rose, looked at me by way of farewell, and left the</text>
<text top="335" left="44" width="276" height="13" font="15">room. I hastily swallowed half a cake, gulped the cup of tea,</text>
<text top="352" left="44" width="276" height="13" font="15">and went out in search of the room to which my luggage</text>
<text top="368" left="44" width="276" height="13" font="15">had been taken. But alas, I could not have a bath or a change</text>
<text top="384" left="44" width="276" height="13" font="15">of clothes – everything was locked up in the suit cases. I was</text>
<text top="400" left="44" width="276" height="13" font="15">greatly embarrassed, and started thinking of breaking them</text>
<text top="416" left="44" width="276" height="13" font="15">open, when someone announced that Sri Maharshi was</text>
<text top="432" left="44" width="276" height="13" font="15">coming to the <i>Darshan</i> Hall. I stopped thinking and rushed</text>
<text top="448" left="44" width="276" height="13" font="15">straight to the Hall with my hat and full suit on. Behind</text>
<text top="464" left="44" width="276" height="13" font="15">me calmly walked in the tall, impressive figure of the</text>
<text top="480" left="44" width="202" height="13" font="15">Maharshi with leisurely though firm steps.</text>
<text top="496" left="45" width="275" height="13" font="15">I was alone in the Hall with him. Joy and peace suffused</text>
