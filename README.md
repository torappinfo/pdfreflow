To compile pdfreflow, try typing `./configure', then `make'.  Pdfreflow
auto-configures the build process, so no further intervention
should be necessary.  Pdfreflow builds with `gcc' by default if it is
available.  If you want to use `cc' instead, type

	CC=cc ./configure

if you are using a Bourne-style shell.  If you are not, the following
may work:

	env CC=cc ./configure
